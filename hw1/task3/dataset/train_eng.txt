I'd be depressed if they asked me to quit the team.
She's pregnant.
I knew I'd broken my wrist the moment I fell.
Do you believe what Tom said?
Show me how to do that.
He lives in a port town.
They were school children then.
I want a donut.
"What I need is not money, but your advice."
Tom can speak French well.
She acknowledged that she couldn't speak French.
Please don't make me go.
We haven't had any rain for over a month.
My eyes are sore.
A baseball came flying through the window.
Did you turn off the living room light?
"Hey, I thought you'd be pleased."
He's our only suspect.
Put out the fire.
I panicked.
Tom pretends he doesn't understand French.
Tom is combing his hair.
I'd like you to put me back on the list.
French is not all that difficult to learn.
Tom gave Mary a kiss on both cheeks.
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
Please sit here.
He has already had lunch.
What time did you come home?
Tom suppressed a yawn.
I think my German is really bad.
"Since it's important, I'll attend to it."
I hope you will have a good time in Europe.
"Could someone make an example sentence in German using the word ""Beispiel?"""

Happy events tend to be accompanied by problems.
Introduce me to your friend over there.
I have no time even for reading.
Were you able to ride a bicycle when you were five years old?
He is a gentleman.
Do you know what he said?
It rained yesterday.
He was accused of murder.
"It took us a long time, but finally we were able to find it."
Do you promise not to tell anyone anything?
My first car was red.
When does it arrive?
There is a bookstore in front of the department store.
It looks like Tom will succeed.
My grandmother had an operation in Germany.
I'd like some cheese.
He's not in.
The reason Tom got sick was because he overate.
Do you have any questions?
I used to love telling jokes.
She cooks for him every day.
The sun sank slowly below the horizon.
Looks delicious. Think I'll try some.
"When I was a university student, I always pulled an all-nighter before a test."
Tom leaned up against me.

He made a sharp turn to the left.
Don't do anything stupid.
Was it an earthquake?
What sort of jewelry are you going to wear with this dress?
World War II ended in 1945.

All you have to do is wash the dishes.
Was the umbrella that you found Tom's?
She got permission to use the car.
My mother died when I was a kid.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Tom and Mary met at the botanical garden.
"Hold your breath, please."
Delete Tom's name from the list.
This is what we want to know.
You'd better do your homework at once.
You can sit here.
Why don't you try and trust Tom a little more?
I have ten pens.
"Except for leap years, February has only 28 days."
I'm really enjoying the challenge.
I'm looking forward to meeting you all after such a long time.
The town has many tall buildings.
"If you would move over, there would be room for everyone."
Everything appears to be going well.
She has a good figure.
Tom handed Mary one of the drinks.
Can you come tomorrow?
I have an idea she will come today.
"If you memorize 5 English words a day, you'll be able to memorize 1,825 words in a year and 182,620 words in 100 years."
I usually get up at 8.
"If you want a pencil, I'll lend you one."
My mother insists that I should not go out after dark.
Tom took off his shirt.
Tom didn't want to bother Mary while she was studying.
That's a stupid question.
I think he is honest.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
She is certain to be surprised.
We close at 2:30.
Wake up.
Is Tom in the garden?
There's no cure for stupidity.
Who killed Tom?
He's intelligent.
Tom was advised by Mary not to go there by himself.
Take out the trash.
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
Don't you feel the house shaking?
I wasn't surprised when Tom showed up at the party because Mary told me he'd be coming.
Tom is accustomed to speaking in public.
Tom came on Monday and went back the day after.
What's your job?
Is that what Tom would want?
I'll get a bucket of water.
I did something stupid.
That's broken.
Were you in Tom's room last night?
I don't even like Tom.
It's been warm the last few days.
The devastation in Kobe was as terrible as I had imagined.

My grandma stooped down and picked up a needle and thread.
Were you busy last Monday afternoon?
It was courteous of him to write a letter of thanks.
I'm still not hungry.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
It's simple and intuitive.
It's the truth.
I said no.
He has a large family.
I teased Tom.
What are you into these days?
"Before you can love others, you need to be able to love yourself."
They lied.
Is that real?
Are you still not ready?
Tom takes care of Mary.
She was dressed in red.
I'm exhausted.
It was apparent that he did not understand what I had said.
What's the difference?
Are you in trouble?
I'm disappointed that he's not here.
Tom and Mary live in the same part of town.
Are we safe here?
Quote me an example.
I'll see you at nine tomorrow morning.
Can you pick out a few good books to read?

He's been taught to accept things as they are.

Can I change the route?
He is older than she is by three years.
Does money bring you happiness?
That's not enough.
"Although he had many toys, his greed made him want more."
Tom shook his head.
Prepare yourself for the future.
I don't think that you need that much money to buy what you need.
Tom looked as if he was about to burst out crying at any time.
What does your father do?
Is the post office within walking distance from here?

Stand still!
He gave up cigarettes.
I think everything happens for a reason.
I've just finished lunch.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
I was confused by her expression.
As many as twenty students were absent.
"I feel like playing cards. ""So do I."""
What is in the desk?
I think that maybe I won't be able to make myself understood in English.
You shouldn't visit my grandfather today.
You ought to ask him for advice.

"I'm sorry, I forgot to do my homework."

Please give me the newspaper when you've finished reading it.
His concert was great.
That lady appears to be rich.
I'd like to see her.
There was a light rain yesterday.
He assumed that the train would be on time.
Why did you decide to study French?

How you've grown!
The sun appeared from behind the clouds.
Do you like dancing?
I have a headache.
"In both appearance and personality, Tom is exactly like his father."
Tom didn't expect to fall in love with Mary.
It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
I've already told Tom that I plan on staying in Boston for another three weeks.
Those photos are hers.
Have you ever stirred your coffee with a fork?

When are you off?
Don't tell my father.
I have little interest in history.
How much did you pay for your car?
No one has died.
He's a big boy.
Please give Tom all these toys.
Help yourself to the cake.
I said I'm sorry.
Do not give in to those demands.
Tom and Mary lived in Boston for a time.
It's garbage.
Bring the laundry in.
"Apart from the weather, it was a good picnic."
Mark the right answer.
That's a bad sign.
He doesn't have any idea how important this meeting is.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.

I disliked it.
There's no soap.
He kicked in a lot of money.
"How do you say ""kaisha"" in English?"

My favorite color is blue.
Please wait a minute.
Do you have any questions about the menu?

Hug me.
I'm not strong enough yet to go to school.
I doubt that Tom will ever learn how to speak French properly.
He's a bit naive.

Drop me a line.
French is their mother tongue.
I had my watch repaired.
"Last night, the temperature went down to ten degrees below zero."
Everybody knows two and two make four.

She is out on an errand.
Tom groaned in his sleep.
Tom is the project manager.
Can we have a talk?
Was that the first time that you rode a horse?

My mother stopped her sewing and picked up her book.
There wasn't a soul in sight.

It was wise for you not to follow his advice.
Take your coat off.

Was Tom happy?
Enjoy your trip.
Try to explain.
He often doesn't come to school.
"As far as I can remember, it was three years ago that we last met."
He went out in spite of the storm.
I could go for a nice hot pizza right now.
Does he speak English?
What time does your first class start?
"Tom is from Australia, right?"
We're currently experiencing some turbulence.
I'm careful.
He is able to speak ten languages.
I think I'm right.

The leaves on the trees change color in the fall.
"Tom isn't from around here, is he?"
Mary went over to the United States in her late teens.
I'd like to ask a question.
Tom isn't interested in Mary at all.
I'm not a boy anymore.
How long did you stay?
"To tell the truth, I didn't go there."
He is seriously ill and unlikely to recover.
Please keep this secret.
Hand me a tissue.

Don't read my journal.
I'm not saying what she did was the right thing to do.
Tom finally quit smoking.
Millions of dollars have been spent trying to shore up the company.
We have run out of gas.
Tom ate like a horse.

Do you like traveling?

Do you usually eat breakfast before seven?
I prefer reading to writing.
"You had better not wear the red dress. ""Why not?"""
I'll give you a call in the morning.

My father is very particular about food.
Who is your favorite author?
I thought that that went well.
We can't trust anyone now.
Tom is counting money.
I'm at a friend's house.
He was perplexed.
You're bleeding.
Why do you like sports so much?
He's a ninja.
Never swap horses while crossing a stream.
Is there any mail for me?
She came to see me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have seen little of him lately.
You're always the cause of my worries.
Was that so hard?
I can no more swim than I can fly.
Tom has the habit of biting his nails.
The boy feared the dark.
The picture you are looking at is a copy of a Picasso.
Tom had no idea why everyone was laughing.
Just answer the question.
It's not so cold today.
"Tom loved Mary, who didn't love him at all."
I believe what he says.
May I sit in the back?
I don't know what I should say.
Tom did that in order to survive.
Where did you live last year?
Go over there.
Tom arrived in Boston less than three weeks ago.
My mother has good handwriting.
I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
You must keep your hands clean.
Tom has no ambition.
It's time to say goodbye.
"Open the window, please."
I am growing to hate the girl.
Are you going to sell Tom your bicycle?
The boy is kind.
Lightning hit that tower.
I was very disappointed when I heard the news.
He cleared his throat.
Thank you for this.
Is this going to take long?
"Sorry, but it all came about so suddenly that I haven't got a handle on the situation yet."
I'll set the alarm for seven o'clock.
Are you cops?
I also put my pens in the drawer.
I sensed what was happening.
Are you ready to go yet?
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm cleaned out.
Why are you always late?
"Even if I had enough money, I still wouldn't buy a Ferrari."
Tom has been studying.
Don't forget that there are exceptions.
I will go.
Tom is very good at catching bugs.
That's a book.
"You don't get up as early as your older sister, do you?"
I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
I'll have this radio fixed tomorrow.
It may snow in the evening.
I have got to go now.
He asked me to speak more slowly.
Calm down!
My car was stolen last night.
It was not until I read the book that I knew about it.
I want to see this movie.
Stop that.
Tom is a dangerous man.
Tom came to Japan as a child.
We don't get along with each other.
I don't hold grudges.
I'd like something to eat.
You don't have to hurry.
I thought it was unusual that he was up so late at night.
Are you in Boston now?
"Are these all your books, Tom?"
I won first prize.
There used to be a bridge here.
Wow! What a big box!
The boy told his mother about it first of all when he got home.
The storm developed into a typhoon.
"He is at work now, but will come back at seven."
It's a waste of time to stay longer.
Tom is actually over thirty.
I believe that's true.
You should be more thoughtful of your safety.
Do you really believe what Tom said?
I want to tell her the truth.
I wish I had been with her then.
"A strawberry ice cream, please."
What is that?
I walked along the river.
Tom was about to leave when Mary knocked on the door.
I'm looking for a new job.
He tried to imagine what the client was like.
The street is full of cars.
Do you think I don't know what's happening?
Tom has a low-pitched voice.
Was it raining in Boston?
You'll feel better.
He did not speak unless spoken to.
Call home!
"Wherever you go, I will follow you."
How are you two doing?
He is the principal of the high school.
I'd like to study in China to improve the level of my Chinese.
What are you writing?
I don't have a bicycle.
Did you order the book?
I feel empty inside.
She asked me to pass her the salt.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 as she had asked him to do.
I must buy a new winter coat.
Tom can't draw as well as I can.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
"Hold on a minute, please."
I haven't seen Tom since October.
I thought it would be difficult for her to get the tickets.
Do you know her?
I'd like to see Tom at 2:30.
We need to scrub the floor.
Let's take your temperature first.
I want to ask them when their wedding day is.
What did you eat when you were in Australia?
Tom got up early this morning.
Are Tom and Mary in Australia?
I'll try.
I do not believe the weather will change for the worse next week.
Old people have difficulty understanding modern technology.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary will leave for Boston.
"With your children away, you must have a lot of free time."
He can count up to ten with his fingers.
He was wounded by a bullet.
I'm not making fun of you.
I am disappointed.
"If it were me, I think I'd try going to a different hospital."
The boy adjusted his cap.
He broke into a house.
Are you through with your work?
Many paintings hang in art museums.
It's really cold today.
Is it hot outside?
I haven't seen much of him recently.
You have a point there.
I've decided to watch this movie.
It doesn't matter what she said.
It's been five years since we moved here.
You can't be two places at once.
Four times five is twenty.
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
Please come next Friday.
I don't want to eat anything.
Are you taking your meds?
The moon came out from behind the clouds.
I've already had lunch.
I have no time.
Canada is a great place for sightseeing.
Will you help me with my French homework?
Please listen to what Tom has to say.
Whose is this bag?
He bumped his head against a post.
They adopted the little girl.
It's supper time.
Get on the bus.
Tom asked me out.
His job is driving a sight-seeing bus.
What you said surprised me.
I can't afford to waste a single yen.
Tom is more experienced in business than me.
She fell from the tree.
Are Tom and Mary getting along?
The lake supplies the city with water.
Who is that old woman?
I'm free this afternoon.
I got a C in English.
Is this radio Tom's?
He wants to go.
Is there anything else you'd like?
It's better to be approximately right than completely wrong.
I've waited two whole hours. I can't wait any longer.
Natural resources are not abundant in Japan.
I'm 18 years old.
I'm eighteen.
Could you wrap this for me?
I'm hungry and thirsty.
Do you want to play hide and seek?
I don't have a computer at home.
"Since I have a cold, I can't taste anything."
I mean it!
The weather stayed cold for three weeks.
"If you change your mind, let me know."
Tom wants to talk to Mary.
Isn't it hard?
You're never too old to learn.
His story sounds strange.
When did you come to Japan?
He is nice.
I don't think that this movie is interesting.
I was amazed to learn I had won.
I watch television every day.
I arrived at 2:30.
I have something I want to ask you.
I wish she were alive now.
Where's the changing room?
You had better hurry. The train leaves at three.
That's why we got divorced.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
The priest blessed the marriage of the happy couple.
Tom grabbed Mary's arm and pulled her towards the door.
Do you really think Tom is from Australia?
I want you to sing a song.
Just take it.
It is no use asking me for money.
What kind of stone is this?
Tom has been following me around.
He had his hair cut short.
Hurry up.
May I speak to you a minute?
Tom went there to meet Mary.
Tom writes with a fountain pen.
Do you want anything to eat?
Tom pointed out some mistakes I had made.
We strolled through the park.
"Even if you wash it, the color won't come out."
I'm starving.
She put her elbows on her knees.
She swims well.
He is likely to arrive soon.
Why did you buy the flowers?
You can set the white of an egg by boiling it.
Are you telling me you've never studied French?
Tom soon adapted himself to school life.
My grandmother suffers from osteoporosis.
Do you know how to make jam?
Hamburgers have gone up this week.
England is going to win the race.
My grandmother on my father's side has turned one hundred.
Shut your eyes.
"How hungry are you, Tom?"
My family isn't all that large.
He can speak Chinese a little.
I must have it done somehow by six.
I will give you this book.
I'll be watching you.
I can't swim well.
Tom opened the door and walked in.
Study English every day.
I saw the picture you took of that fish.
"Two beers, please."
We must tell him about it.
Are we there yet?
When will it start?
Don't worry. It's easy.
You look relaxed.
You can easily identify Tom because he is very tall.
"Sit down, please."
Tom was listening to his iPod as he worked out.
He's been friendly with my kid brother.
I have little money now.
Would you like a cup of milk?
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
You need a license to drive a car.
He came in spite of the heavy snow.
Let's go grab a hot dog or something.
The picture looks better at a distance.
He made me a suit.
Are you in trouble?
I will help you.
Please wait for me at the entrance of the building.
The picnic was held in the gym on account of the rain.
Would you mind waiting a minute?
I don't want to work overtime.
This truck is in need of repair.
This sounds reasonable.
Why have you shut the door?
Is there time?
"How long will the meeting last? ""For two hours."""
He climbed down from the tree.
"He's an Englishman, but lives in India."
I do not have a sister.
The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in the year 1806.
Tom shut the office door.
I like summer the best.
Why is Tom wet?
There are many craters on the moon.
She didn't come after all.
She got a slight burn on her hand while cooking.
It appeared that she was trying to keep back tears.
He likes reading books.
Her skin is smooth.
Is it true that horses sleep while standing up?
She went to the market to buy fresh vegetables.
He lost his job.
You left the refrigerator door open.
I want to sleep a little more.
I can't understand why Tom doesn't want to go with us.
Do you want to get married?
I'm not chicken.
All's fair in love and war.
Don't waste your time on trifles.
I hope you get better soon.
This is a secret.
He ran as fast as he could.
Tom was supposed to meet me at 2:30.
Tom doesn't like to talk about it.
I don't have enough money to buy the computer that I want to buy.
It's time to go to bed.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
I'll do it later on.
The witness identified the thief in the police lineup.
Christmas fell on Saturday that year.
Tom was completely soaked by the rain.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Help me!
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
I resign.
Thanks for the help.
No one went near him.
She greeted him waving her hand.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
Show me today's paper.
I speak French much better than Tom does.
He is always laughing.
Do you want me to drive?
Tom graduated in 2013.
Tom was killed in the accident.
Tom wears black-rimmed glasses.
How many credits is this course?
Tom towel-dried his hair.
Come and see me when you have time.
We'd appreciate a reply.
He has more books than he can ever read.
Which cat is yours?
We must not be late.
The tickets are 20 yen each.
Do I have to stay in the hospital?
"You look pale. Are you sick? ""Not exactly."""
Has anything good happened lately?
Have you read anything interesting lately?
"Did she buy a watch? ""Yes, she bought one."""
She is teaching us French.
I think I'll give Tom an egg timer.
"Sorry, I've gone and jumped to conclusions again."
May I use your toilet?
"By the time Tom got there, the concert had already begun."
He's good at telling jokes.
Do you drink alcohol?
I think she's an honest woman.
I don't want to have children. Is that abnormal?
Don't throw in the towel.
I ended up winning.
This chair is uncomfortable.
Tom was attacked by a dog.
I want to cry.
The audience appeared bored.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
Do you think we're stupid?
How did you learn about that news?
I only did as I was told.
Can I ask you to join me?
Why do you like coffee strong?
"Here, try my pen."
How tragic!
"Anyway, I'm glad you were able to broach this difficult subject."
They called their new country the Republic of Liberia.
It's weird.
Tom's leg had gone to sleep so he was unable to stand up.
I have a reservation.
She is very intelligent.
Tom asked his doctor to change his medication.
I closed the door quietly so I wouldn't wake the baby up.
I'm going to be a father.
It's cold.
Is the baby OK?
I don't think he is fit for the job.
Is it over yet?
I go to church every day.
Are you sure there's nothing in there?
Do you care what other people think about us?
Why do you ask me that?
He asked for a beer.
My ear is ringing.
I plucked a daisy for her.
"How much did you pay for this? ""About 20 euros."" ""Wow! That's incredibly cheap."""
Tom doesn't eat a lot.
I was punched by Tom.
Is she your mom?
I don't like your taste in colors.
I don't have to go there alone.
Are you expecting somebody?
You'd better avoid discussion of religion and politics.
"If I drop out of contact, let the police know, OK?"
Her husband is one of my friends.
Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city in Vietnam.
How did you get to know about her?
"I live near her house, but I seldom see her."
Lock the door.
He is my classmate.
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
Do you know Tom's address?
Why don't you go play outside?
Is it near your house?
He is writing a novel.
Tom says he has actually seen a ghost.
Take a deep breath and then relax.
I like white wine better than red.
Hurry!
I sometimes hear rumors about her.
Tom didn't tell me everything.
Tom was in a hurry so he left his bed unmade.
It's impossible to learn English in a month.
I feel listless and have a throbbing headache.
It will be hot tomorrow.
I plan to go to the movies.
"I live in a town, but my parents live in the country."
Those two children were the same age.
She made arrangements to get him into a good hospital.
Gold is similar in color to brass.
I regretted having wasted a great deal of time.
He is familiar with the subject.
"Excuse me, could you show me how to use the washing machine?"
Do you think tomorrow will be a nice day?
Tom repeated the question.
"This flower is beautiful, isn't it?"
I'll be right there.
This meat is good.
She left France for the United States.
"How old is she? ""She is twelve years old."""
Which player are you paying the most attention to this year?
We can't see the other side of the moon.
Where is your house?
She was noted for her good looks at school.
They fed a black and a white dog.
I wonder why we have ear lobes.
You have to trust your instincts.
"On cloudy days, you can hear distant sounds better than in clear weather."
I'll return at 6:30.
This knife is dull.
He has started to write a novel.
"She requested help, but no one came."
It'll cost at least five dollars.
She stared at him with frightened eyes.
Close the book.
Why are you so surprised?
"You're upset with me, aren't you?"
He asked a very good question.
Tom forced a smile.
Are you Tom's friend?
I was a kid at that time.
They visited me occasionally.
I'd like to try it.
You must be kidding!
I don't feel like speaking French today.
He came after you left.
You'd better be careful not to catch cold.
Move quietly.
Don't believe what he says.
Is that love?
What surprised me most when I first entered college was how few of my classmates knew how to study efficiently.
Is Tom really going to go to Australia by himself?
I'm looking forward to receiving a favorable answer from you.
I'll accept your offer.
He was leaning against the wall.
I've decided to go there.
I'll be waiting for you at the station tomorrow morning.
They left the town an hour ago.
Does Tom still remember me?
Mary stayed up late last night.
I quit smoking.
It is less muggy today than it was yesterday.
"My father used to smoke, but now he doesn't."
We flew across the Atlantic.
"Good morning, everyone."
I came to Tokyo three years ago and have been living here ever since.
I want to stay with you until next Monday.
We ate lunch with Tom yesterday.
Did you enjoy your trip?
There is a bridge over the pond.
I'll take it.
My father plans to go overseas next week.
Take care!
We arrived at the office on time.
My daughter has grown out of all her old clothes.
I watched a Swedish movie last night.
"Are you going to tell Tom to leave, or should I?"
I hate tomatoes.
I don't think that it will rain tomorrow.
What is in this box?
You want the Number 11. It stops in front of the post office.
"I'm sorry, we have no vacancies."
Tom asked his girlfriend to pardon him for forgetting her birthday.
It is difficult to adapt oneself to sudden changes of temperature.
Tom isn't as old as he looks.
She achieved her goal.
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
They have very little to live on.
I am a stranger here.
You look Japanese.
He threw a stone into the pond.
Tom cracked open the window.
Have you been told where the meeting will be?
I don't see eye to eye with my father.
You'll never know unless you try.
I can't stand liars.
Read as many newspapers as you can so as to keep up with the times.
Is there anything you need to do today?
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
You shouldn't have eaten the fish raw.
I have to leave now.
"When did you buy it? ""Let's see. I bought it last week."""
He always keeps his word.
Let's have tea at 3:00.
Don't worry about me so much.
This water has a bad smell.
Please don't go out of your way on my account.
I studied really hard in order to pass the exam.
I suddenly got a craving to eat some crisp roast chicken skin.
The media has a lot of influence on the outcome of an election.
We postponed our departure because of the storm.
Is that what Tom wanted?
Why did you lend money to someone like him?
"There were no customers, so we closed the shop early."
She is quiet.
I don't want to drink anything cold.
I let the cat out of the house.
I'll go and ask Tom.
I'm slightly hungry.
This road will take you down to the edge of Lake Biwa.
Don't tell Tom where I live.
Did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?
I never expected such a nice hotel in a place like this.
The old woman smiled with a sigh of relief.
Is there anyone there?
I have known Tom since I was a little boy.
My fever won't go away.
The north wind blew continuously all day.
Cancer may be related to viruses of some kind.
I'm the one who made that decision.
It'll probably rain.
Where can I get tickets?
"May I borrow your dictionary? ""Of course."""
I've just eaten some sushi and drunk a beer.
She turned off the lights.
Has Tom been crying?
He had one daughter.
I thought you might know where Tom went.
These grapes taste sour.
I like French.
I was in London most of the summer.
What do you think of my new coat?
Please call him up.
We arrived at an agreement after two hours' discussion.
How much are these shoes?
Is Tom still a university student?
I'll go get changed.
"Even if you don't feel like eating, you should eat something. If you don't, you won't last until lunch time."
I am learning to play the guitar now.
"Do you have anything to do? ""Nothing in particular."""
I really do love it.
You have cancer.
I asked Tom to clean his room.
Tom is rarely late.
I don't think that Tom is selfish.
I feel guilty about it.
What're you doing?
Were you working last night?
Who's your friend?
The tower leaned slightly to the left.
Time's up. Please pass in your exams.
I can't lend you any money.
He carved a Buddhist image out of wood.
Are you waiting for something?
They canceled the festival.
The king and his family live in the royal palace.
I'm aware of that possibility.
She's going to have a baby.
He served as chairman for three years.
That's not very important to me.
"Now, what do you think?"
The sky became darker and darker.
What narrow stairs!
The chances are that he will win.
He was at home.
I listen to music.
I should have worn a coat.
Lake Biwa is the largest lake in Japan.
I will be back soon.
Is the fish still alive?
We all like cycling.
He promised that he would write to me once in a while.
I want to stay for several days.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
My mother is making me a birthday cake.
The little boy embraced his dog.
"No, thank you."
All plants need water and light.
Tom put the letter opener back in the desk drawer.
Tom is an old student of mine.
I'm certain I'll win the tennis match.
How old is he?
She had never dreamed of meeting him abroad.
Don't worry about what Tom said.
I put my coat on the table.
I play tennis an hour a day.
The water was lukewarm.
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
I wish I could have spoken Spanish.
I don't need a tissue.
Tom wants to be an astronaut.
Can I sit here?
"I play chess, too."
Tom didn't know Mary liked to cook.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
His opinions carry weight.
I'm not Tom.
Tom was born and raised in a small town.
Do you think Tom can speak French?
Where is the restroom?
I have to go now.
The train leaves at 2:30 p.m.
Please explain the procedure.
"It seems like yesterday, but it's actually nearly ten years since we first met."
I have a friend who feeds his dog strawberries.
He married for money.
"Did she buy a watch? ""Yes, she did."""
We're all supposed to know the traffic rules.
I trust him.
The house is in need of repair.
Only a handful of people know the fact.
Few people live to be a hundred years old.
I love Italian food.
Tom might be able to translate this into French.
I think that Tom hasn't left yet.
I play the piano.
What room in your house do you spend the most time in?
Let me in.
They grow oranges in California.
She is getting breakfast ready.
It is becoming warmer day by day.
Drive safely.
It's very odd.
He is by nature a generous person.
I don't have any children.
Ring the bell when you want me.
Can I use your telephone?
She didn't give me my money back.
I want to deposit some money.
He can also speak Russian.
Tom made a fortune in oil.
Please let me know as soon as it's decided.
He had his parents die in the plane accident.
You should grab your bag and hurry home.
My mother is now in the kitchen cooking.
Tom beat Mary black and blue.
She kept her eyes closed.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
May I pay with a credit card?
I won't assist you.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
Tom is a policeman.
Oh no!
Let's try calling Tom.
I'm clean.
"I was tired, but I couldn't sleep."
Why don't you answer?
Will you lend me your bicycle?
Let's play chess.
Tom always worries about his daughter.
I have something to show you.
Am I bothering you?
My father gestured with his hand for me to leave the room.
You cannot kill yourself by holding your breath.
You're always exaggerating.
Do you have a dog?
I found the cat.
"A long time ago, people had very short lifespans."
Don't talk!
"It's simply that I don't really understand what an ""oddball"" is when said by a Mixi user."
Please be careful not to break this vase.
It's going to take a long time.
She lacks common sense.
The other day I went fishing for the first time in my life.
I was born in 1988.
Can you explain why you were late?
"In the short time Tom was away from his desk, Mary scribbled something in his textbook."
I like that answer.
I'll take care of the dog till tomorrow.
I should change my profile picture.
Actions speak louder than words.
Can I borrow cash with this card?
Cookie would be a good name for a cat.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
You are always late.
Tom sat on a bench smoking a cigarette.
She answered my letter right away.
The problem is not settled yet.
How do you milk a cow?
She looked for her bag here and there.
I got sunburned.
Tom was transferred to the head office in Boston.
Do you have any brothers?
Tom will probably be back soon.
Tom is reading a book.
Tom and Mary live in a small log cabin.
I take my hat off to her for her effort.
"If there were no sun, we wouldn't be able to live."
She returned a book to the library.
This part of the library is closed to the public.
"Shut the door, please."
He has three children.
Can you cash these for me?
Are you suggesting that I'm wrong?
I have a ringing in my ears.
I got a phone call from him just as I was about to go to bed.
"Hey, this pizza isn't bad. Not bad at all."
I've got something that I really have to do.
This is one of the reasons I like Boston.
Quiet down.
Why don't you tell me about it?
I already told you not to smoke in your room.
They are very big apples.
Are you saying Tom was right?
How was the concert?
May I take your picture?
I can't lend you this book.
Tom didn't drink the milk.
"Without your help, we couldn't have done it."
I've never eaten raw fish.
Will you tell me where I'm wrong?
He is very stingy with his money.
Tom speaks almost no French.
He is afraid of dogs.
That's common sense.
Give me a chance to make you proud of me.
I took it for granted that you would join.
"Once upon a time, there lived a cruel king."
Can I carry this on the plane?
I paid her five dollars.
He reached his goal.
We can't live without oxygen.
You dropped your pencil.
I have a bad pain here.
The stew smells delicious.
I'm in a very good mood today.
Tom fell from his horse.
I met him for the first time.
I expected him to fail the exam.
We've been friends ever since.
It's very cloudy. I think it's going to rain.
She has too many boyfriends.
He broke the record.
I bought a VCR at that store for a low price.
Tom is in his mid thirties.
It's stopped raining.
Let's wait here until he turns up.
Nobody knows why.
He traveled to Hawaii with the family.
The teacher didn't let the students ask any questions.
Stop it.
I'm a civilian.
I ate some peanuts.
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
These shoes are too tight.
Let me think about it a little longer.
I cleared up my desk.
The teacher wrote English sentences on the blackboard.
"We can't live on 150,000 yen a month."
He rejected our offer.
I'm sorry for being late.
Tom kicked Mary hard.
He who hesitates is lost.
Wait a moment.
She's six years older than me.
You forgot to turn off the light.
"Bartender, I'd like to have a drink."
He lives in Osaka.
"With those results, you won't be able to go to university."
He is a fast runner.
Tom forwarded John the email that he received from Mary.
He enjoys watching baseball games on TV.
Tom's daughter pretended not to know him when he came to pick her up from school in his battered old car.
Unbelievable!
Sorry I laughed so much.
He is about forty.

We'll have to camp out if we can't find a place to stay.

It's been about two days since I put the body in the refrigerator.
Many people think I'm crazy.
Where will you have lunch today?
Why are you all laughing?
How many barbers work in that barbershop?
Tom's heart was filled with sorrow.

It seems it'll rain tomorrow.
Is there anything else you want?
Tom's brother is a lawyer.
He was sound asleep.
It's about time you went to school.
"It is hard to define ""triangle."""
Tom went to bed.
This turkey tastes good.
Try not to yawn.
I had a dream about you last night.
I must remember to see her.
It's time you went to the barber's.
What time is it?
Tom is already studying French.
Tom ran up the stairs.
Please stay close by.
Let's suppose it's true.
Were you thinking about me?
Tom was Mary's boyfriend last year.
"Wait, don't shoot!"
Tom is as fast as a leopard.
"Will it rain tomorrow? ""I hope not."""
This is a pretty good camera.
It's a real bargain.
I really like you.
Let me hear your frank opinion.
Never speak to me again.
I am afraid of having trouble.
I believe his name is Tom.
Will it rain this afternoon?
I wish I were dead.
"I've apologized, so lay off, OK?"
She made a good speech.
She presented him with the trophy.
I hit the mark with the arrow.
I believe in ghosts.
Are you saying Tom is a liar?
How many bags of potato chips did you buy?
Gasoline is sold by the liter.
His aunt has three cats.
He is a person who never cuts corners.
He was tired from his long walk.
Tom was homeschooled.
It was past midnight when we arrived.
Tom left last Monday.
I like Tom.
Tom's bed's empty.
Are we allowed to take pictures here?
You're the best man for the job.
Will Tom come today?
3 times 5 is 15.
I think he's right.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
Tom was in a very good mood.
The engine died.
We saw a castle in the distance.
Tom didn't call the police.
The car he was riding crashed into a train.
He is a bank clerk.
He wants to go to America.
You must not lose sight of your goal in life.
Was it Tom who ate my sandwich?
"Unfortunately, the report is true."
"How many pumpkins do you want? ""Three, please."""
I'd like to stay at your hotel.
Does Tom have a younger brother?
I don't think she is fit for the job.
Why on earth did Tom do that?
You've been quite helpful.
I'm very afraid of snakes.
This is the key that opened that door.
Don't you want to tag along?
He devoted his life to his study.
Have you finished your homework already?
He drank himself to death.
I had to drive myself to the hospital.
You don't have to answer those questions.
They announced that a storm was coming.
My father is in his fifties.
Are you avoiding me?
It's frozen hard.
I can't praise him enough.
May I have a cup of tea?
Tom walked in the room.
Are you free now?
Your diet is going to be really unbalanced if all you eat is hamburgers.
I said good morning.
This is it.
Look! There's a cat in the kitchen.
Everybody knows Tom can speak French well.
I'm feeling nervous.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
Is the bank open?
Tom misses Boston.
I wonder how Tom put up with Mary for so many years.
A cat was sitting on the chair.
Stop scowling.
We talked about a variety of topics.
"In Japan, we drive on the left side of the road."
Tom was bullied.
I wonder why Tom is so depressed.
Our school is fifty years old.
Do you want to have some coffee?
I awoke to find myself completely refreshed.
How long has Tom been missing?
Were you on time for work today?
"Whenever I talk to my father, I realize that he has a lot more experience than I do."
Tom told us that he had a headache.
Is it all right to eat out tonight?
There is a little water left.
Try to act your age.
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."
Come in.
Someone stole my bag.
It is time to reflect on your past.
I did the washing while the baby was sleeping.
"Seen from a distance, the big rock looks like an old castle."
You made a wise decision.
There is a cat under the bed.
What's the most important thing in life?
"In my room, there are no clocks."
Thanks very much.
What is the capital of Haiti?
It's very humid.
I had a good time yesterday afternoon.
Tom knows where Mary is.
Tom is wearing a surgical mask.
I have plans.
Come over!
My mother was disappointed by my failure.
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
Are you still good at baseball?
Don't shout.
The Shinanogawa river is the longest river in Japan.
"I looked all around, but I could see nobody there."
I'm jealous that you have a good boss.
It's 3:30.
She wouldn't have married him if she had known him better.
Actions speak louder than words.
Both Tom and Mary are from Australia.
I will explain the situation to you later on.
He is acquainted with my wife.
This is outside my area of expertise.
She's a modern girl.
She lives in a large house.
They called off their visit to London.
When does it end?
I wanted to know what happened.
He might not be happy.
It's not healthy for you.
Tom is lying on his back.
It turned out that I was right.
The truth is that I don't know anything about it.
She speaks good English.
We celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary yesterday.
I'm starving.
He fell in love with her.
Do you usually eat dessert?
"Tom isn't really shy, is he?"
His advice didn't help much.
This problem is difficult for me to solve.
Tom and Mary started a band.
That is my school.
Will you do me a favor?
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Is Tom's house new?
Tom started an advertising agency.
Tom realized there were no cars parked in front of the school.
"Nowadays, almost every home has one or two televisions."
He seems unable to swim.
Tom decided to quit smoking.
Would you like to add anything to what I've said?
I found it difficult to understand what he was saying.
"Tom was confused, too."
I study many languages.
Are you looking for us?
He came close to losing an eye.
That's a joke.
Are you free?
Tom will have that fixed right away.
Is Tom still on the phone?
Please take this away.
You have good taste in music.
We live in the atomic age.
I am sorry to say that I cannot help you.
Are you going out today?
I bought a loaf of bread for breakfast.
The police are looking into the cause of the traffic accident.
Tom was shorter than me up until last year.
Can I try doing that again?
I lost face.
I don't feel up to eating anything tonight.
I want a boiled egg.
He will come after all.
Did you play hooky yesterday?
We didn't have school today.
Where were you going?
He is the boss's private secretary.
The pain has gone.
I'm no liar.
Tom always speaks French.
Why am I so bad at allocating my time?
"A group of foreigners arrived in Edo, in other words Tokyo."
He vowed to give up smoking.
Tom wrote Mary a letter.
I walked along the river.
All you have to do is sweep the floor.
He loses his temper quite easily.
Is she at home?
Anything else?
"Tom, you're wanted on the phone."
I live too far away.
Tom is wearing a Red Cross button.
I can't do it by myself.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Walking to work in this heat isn't a good idea.
It'll be my birthday soon.
The jet landed at Tokyo.
She seldom goes out.
I made up my mind to do the work no matter how hard it might be.
You don't need to hurry.
Is there anyone here who can speak English?
"He failed in the scheme, much to the disappointment of his father."
Just enjoy it.
Mary is Tom's mother-in-law.
I want to become a journalist.
Tom asked Mary to get some glasses from the kitchen.
"When Tom broke his leg, he had to use crutches for three months."
She traveled around Japan.
I can't stand babies crying.
The game has been indefinitely postponed.
America is a land of immigrants.
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends.
My computer doesn't boot up anymore.
I must go now.
I learned a lot from Tom.
I ironed the handkerchief.
Is this real gold?
Tom saw something unusual.
Mother is getting breakfast ready.
See you soon.
"However hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can."
"After the meal, I asked for the bill."
"Hey, I'm on your side."
"Nowadays, we often use the term ""senior citizen"" to refer to old people."
I recommend you to go by train.
Tom left his son a fortune.
I have to go now.
You won't need an umbrella today.
Tom was too angry to speak.
Tom said he would stop smoking.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
Don't hate me.
He doesn't seem to be aware of the conflict between my father and me.
"Without your help, I would have drowned."
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I want to learn how to draw.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Tom is losing consciousness.
"Having nothing to do, I watched television."
My sister is playing with a doll.
I wonder if life exists on other planets.
It's hard for me to put my thoughts into words.
There was a light rain yesterday.
I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
I like to play golf.
How many people are there in your family?
Please contact me later.
Would you mind waiting a few minutes?
I am learning two foreign languages.
The dog was hit by a truck.
The meeting was put off until next week.
Tom went to Australia last month.
My parents were satisfied with my grades this year.
Why aren't you in school?
Autumn is just around the corner.
I thought that a game of tennis might be fun.
He never takes any notice of what his father says.
He studied the way birds fly.
Tom disassembled the clock.
I got up earlier than usual to get the first train.
How tall are you?
I met him the other day.
"If you make your own clothes, it will save you money."
How can I meet this quota?
Is Tom very mad at me?
She has gone out.
It's normal to make mistakes.
Who does Tom want to go to Boston with?
You can download the instruction manual for the heat exchanger here.
They waited.
Don't be sad.
What else do you have?
The girls amused themselves playing games.
I could swim well when I was a boy.
I have a lot more homework than Tom does.
We tried to persuade him.
Tom looks very sleepy.
Tom understands.
Is Tom handsome?
Have you ever been to Tom's home?
You're telling me.
"My uncle went to Mexico in 1983, never to come back."
I heard him humming in the shower.
She has the habit of clearing her throat whenever she's nervous.
My hobby is reading novels.
All the food was gone.
She smiled at him.
I had a good night's rest.
I don't mind reading manuals.
We need more workers.
She went on working till he called her.
What's so interesting about baseball?
There's some water left.
That girl wanted to become a movie star.
I'm starved.
I think that Tom is lucky.
Have you eaten breakfast already?
He was very old.
Did Tom tell you?
The car broke down after half an hour's driving.
Tom opened the door and the dog ran out.
Does she still have a temperature?
Here he is!
"Where do you go more often, Boston or Chicago?"
Buy eggs at the store on your way home.
Tom was condemned to death.
I feel perfectly fine.
Did he say anything about it?
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
He is a real gentleman.
"Some people like cats, others prefer dogs."
I want to sleep a little longer.
I am disappointed that my friend is not here.
Do you have a motorcycle?
Tom left Australia the next day.
He's too tall to stand up straight in this room.
How many times a week does the football team practice?
How about tomorrow night?
Tom went into the kitchen to drink some water.
His life was a long series of failures.
She gets up at seven.
He gets a high salary.
I write in my diary every day.
I'll do that for sure.
"When I use contacts, my eyes feel dry and become red."
My parents wouldn't allow me to go by myself.
Life's short.
Prince Charles will be the next king of England.
I like his music.
Don't you threaten me.
I had to go home and change.
Next week a family will move in.
That is a good idea.
"On building sites, hard hats must be worn at all times."
The priest skillfully drew a picture of a priest on a folding screen.
Behave yourself.
"Suddenly, it began to rain."
The scenery of the Alps left a lasting impression on me.
Her feelings are easily hurt.
I'll send you home in my car.
My brother is in Australia now.
Tom is extremely clean.
When is school over?
I'm going to see Tom right now.
Go and find Tom.
This looks interesting.
Let's move it.
Moths are attracted by light.
We loaded a lot of luggage into the car.
The meeting starts at 2:30.
He likes to watch the birds fly above his head.
Will there be anything else?
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
He is an expert at solving such problems.
What do you think of the new teacher?
How much does a can of beer cost?
Is it open on Sunday?
I almost got a perfect score.
I wonder who'll do that tomorrow.
He couldn't bring himself to believe her story.
Rice is grown in rainy regions.
Don't worry. My dog won't bite you.
Why don't we eat at a restaurant tonight?
"Tom isn't romantic, but Mary is."
"In order to do that, you have to take risks."
I went there early so I could get a good seat.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like him."
They collect our garbage every Monday.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
Strangers close by are better than family far away.
This is the key that I've been looking for.
Tom put off his departure till Sunday.
"Tom was supposed to buy flowers for Mary, but he forgot."
It is necessary for you to start at once.
"It's sad, but true."
Tom doesn't need a babysitter.
Aren't you and Tom friends?
He has been busy since this morning.
"Tom is an honest person, so I like him."
"You don't have enough money, do you?"
Let's be friends forever.
It began to rain before I got home.
I wish I were an only child.
"It is better to remain silent, than to talk without purpose."
"In basketball, tall players have an advantage."
I wanted to be famous.
I'm eating a pear.
He was arrested because he stole the money.
How many hours a day do you sleep?
The train was delayed on account of a heavy snow.
We have to wait.
My head hurts.
I believe Tom is right.
We have little time to waste.
A foolish impulse made me say what I should have left unsaid.
He works at the bank.
The computer might not work.
Do you have any experience working at a restaurant?
It's my treat.
My hands and legs are swollen.
Next Monday and Tuesday are holidays.
Tom has been studying in his room since dinner.
How old do I look?
Where is the exit?
I've never been on a blind date.
It takes an hour to get to the station on foot.
It's too hot.
He decided to give up smoking once and for all.
There was nothing but an old chair in the room.
She tried a third time.
There is little water left in the canteen.
Tom has a high opinion of himself.
My watch gains five seconds a day.
The bus went over the cliff.
What's your home phone number?
Didn't you hear her speaking French?
I wonder whether the weather will hold.
We had fish for dinner last night.
"Do you want to go for a walk? ""Let's wait until the sun goes down a bit."""
Why don't you go home?
My premonition turned out to be right.
The door was locked and we couldn't enter.
The girl brought me a red and a white rose.
Give me your phone number.
"The students are happy, but the teachers are not."
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
I make it a rule to get up early in the morning.
"Excuse me, can you lower your voice a little bit?"
Tom didn't agree to do that.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
I wonder where Tom is.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
I'm satisfied with my current income.
Please come right now.
All hope of winning the game vanished.
Tom is the kind of guy you just can't hate.
I had a sandwich for lunch.
My grandfather died in the Second World War.
I'll attend.
Is Tom well?
Always keep a handkerchief in your pocket.
Where are the elevators?
Please come right away.
Who ate the cheese?
Is anything missing?
Did Tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend?
He has never been abroad.
Tom wants to live in the country.
The boy rowing the boat is a friend of mine.
Won't you come with me?
We ran out of gas on the way there.
Did you feel the earthquake this morning?
Here's some medicine for diarrhea.
I wonder why I'm so sleepy.
I'm getting better.
I don't usually have to work on Sundays.
He can't tell right from wrong.
Would you draw me a map?
Is it OK if I sit here?
I have no choice but to do that.
"If it snows a lot tomorrow, let's make a snowman."
Tom shouldn't have told Mary what John did.
The deer fell a prey to the lion.
"The bill, please."
Don't be cruel to animals.
What is happiness?
He spoke slowly enough for everyone to understand.
We look forward to receiving the catalog soon.
The labor union called for a strike.
"I will go, rain or shine."
Would you draw me a map?
She held her baby in her arms.
A white-haired man was playing an accordion outside the shop.
My friends invited me to dinner.
You shouldn't judge a person by their looks.
Are you going to come back?
Tom buttered his bread.
Teach me how you do that.
"As soon as he saw a policeman, he ran away."
My husband is a very good cook.
I've decided not to live in Boston.
She had no intention of quarreling with him.
This photograph reminds me of my childhood.
"If I start eating potato chips, I can't stop."
Can you meet tonight?
Is Tom happy?
The ice is not thick enough to hold our weight.
Is this your first time in Japan?
You can get to her house in a variety of different ways.
I stand corrected.
Everyone likes Tom.
She came last.
Please take a seat.
I believe in you.
You can see the sun setting from the window.
That’s an even better deal.
She asked after my parents' health when I met her the other day.
You need not have come so early.
Let's rest here.
Everything fell into my lap.
You'll see a lot of high mountains through the window.
There is a fork missing.
I'm just about to check in.
There is no wind today.
I already know everything.
I need a favor.
Would you like another apple?
Never did I dream that I would meet you here.
I retired last year.
Tom hid under the table.
Step aside.
I want to name my daughter Mary.
Could you wait a moment?
I've decided to stay.
Tom shaves only about three times a week.
I'm for it.
Will she get well soon?
Is there a treatment?
Write your name in capitals.
"Today, I want to run on the beach."
"If you want to lose weight, then the best thing to do is to eat properly and get a lot of exercise."
Everything's fine.
I need to buy new skis.
I want another beer.
Let's spread the map on the table and talk it over.
Put your room in order.
They left one after another.
What's the scoop on your new boyfriend?
I want to take a rest.
I bought this book at Maruzen Bookstore.
She asked after my parents' health when I met her the other day.
I finished doing the work before supper.
You should've done so.
Mary went to the nail salon.
I was surprised that Tom spoke French so well.
She has good handwriting.
Tom and I used to work at the same place.
It was because of the storm that the trains were halted.
I am not good at sports.
He dug a hole.
Come here soon.
I have been to the airport to see my father off.
Could you let me see your notes?
"I'm tired, but I still have a lot of work I need to do."
I had been working for two hours when I suddenly felt sick.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
His house is somewhere around here.
I smell something rotten.
She is wearing a blue dress.
I used to swim every day when I was a child.
I was brainwashed.
Are you still waiting for someone?
It isn't expensive.
That bridge is very beautiful.
Tom came to help.
He has quite a few valuable paintings.
Are you waiting for anybody?
You've won.
I like both dogs and cats.
We're not as young as we used to be.
When did you change your address?
"Tom is the one with the car, not me."
I had not gone a mile when it began to rain.
I don't think so.
"I'd like to check in, please."
Tom took his mask off.
I walk twenty miles a day.
Now he is recognized as one of the most promising writers.
"Check, please."
He answered incorrectly.
I cried all night.
This may not be a real diamond.
Tom blacked out.
I'm out of gas.
The download is complete.
Can you do that?
I'm going to carry out this plan.
Tom retired.
I'll act as a guide for you.
I think so.
I don't know which is better.
Tom doesn't love Mary anymore.
I want to know when my baggage is going to arrive.
She was occupied with household work.
"I tried to be calm, but finally I lost my temper."
Is it October already?
This beer is cold.
Tom hasn't had anything but water since last night.
I left home early so I wouldn't miss the train.
She always lets her children do what they want to.
I want to know why Tom is still not married.
Either way is fine.
Sorry I'm late. I overslept.
How many hot dogs do you sell a day?
Can the rumor be true?
I knew Tom was from Boston.
What grade are you in?
I'm in trouble now.
I heard you bought a house.
He turned pale with fright.
Don't scare me like that!
He is acquainted with the custom.
It doesn't bother me if you take that book.
I'll take you up on that.
His success is attributed more to hard work than to genius.
Both Tom and I can speak French.
Are you OK?
Are you sure this information is reliable?
They supplied the soldiers with enough food and water.
I am poor at tennis.
Is it OK if I go out for a walk?
Do I need to reconfirm?
The children were skinny dipping.
Both Tom and Mary are newspaper reporters.
My house faces to the south.
Tom raised three children all by himself.
The twins look so much alike it's next to impossible to distinguish one from the other.
What are you thinking about?
I was lost.
"It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters."
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
Please tell me the way to the post office.
Would you mind shutting the door?
I haven't worn this tie in almost three years.
The man caught the girl by the wrist.
I often hear her play the piano.
"It was nice to meet you, and I look forward to hearing from you."
Don't be late for school.
Tom had a quick breakfast.
Is lunch ready?
Is there anyone here who knows someone in Australia?
Everything's ready.
Tom didn't want Mary to go to Boston.
I usually go to the barber once a month.
Cook for me.
That hurts.
She stared at him in astonishment.
I left my umbrella behind in the taxi.
I'm depending on you.
Tom would like to be reincarnated as a woman.
What are you going to do after you leave school?
I ran into Mary at a party last week.
Not many people like Tom.
We try.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
Nothing seems to grow in this soil.
Do they all cost the same?
I work even on Sunday.
Is Tom in the bathroom?
I don't know if he is a doctor.
Have a good vacation.
"These flowers aren't only beautiful, but they smell nice."
We had to walk all the way to the station.
There was no bathroom.
I'm behind him.
I sat by his side.
Tom often dreams about his girlfriend.
Knock it off.
I'm not sure that Tom can do that again.
He rarely went there.
I have seen that girl before.
Go away.
Tom is impulsive.
What's up?
I like Tom because he's honest.
There is no other country in the world where earthquakes are as frequent as in Japan.
He is generous with his money.
We'd like another bottle of wine.
That's not important to me.
She went to the hospital yesterday.
Read the kinds of books that you find interesting.
I'll stay home if it rains tomorrow.
Thanks for the tip.
Did anybody get injured?
"To put it frankly, he is a critic rather than a writer."
I'd like to borrow about three hundred thousand dollars.
The moon came out from behind the cloud.
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
I want you to do it at once.
He continued the experiment.
I may work in Australia next year.
Do you really think it's bad?
I'm so happy for you guys.
Was anyone else injured?
I'll let you know all about it later on.
"Not knowing what to say, I remained silent."
"Tom is usually right, isn't he?"
It's too expensive.
I'll give these puppies to anyone who likes dogs.
I would love a cold glass of beer.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
This desk is better than that one.
I'd like to travel around the world.
I live within 200 meters of the station.
I wonder who has come.
We have a lot of rain in June.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Do you have any ones?
That's a good question.
I'm not exactly sure.
I'm biased.
I'm terribly sorry.
She is mad at me.
Take anything you like.
We're going out.
He takes a bath every morning.
It happened quite recently.
He sat in front of me.
I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.
He gets his hair cut once a month.
I know every inch of the town.
"Not a drop of rain fell for a month, so they had to dig a well."
That is out of the question.
How much did you pay for your car?
Can I park my car here?
Most people think I'm crazy.
He translated the verse into English.
I saw Tom in the parking lot when I left.
What are some of the difficulties you face in your work?
I want the red balloon.
Six months is a long time to wait.
Was yesterday a cold day?
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Boston is pretty far away from here.
Are you all ready to go hiking?
He lay on his back.
Tom doesn't know what to do first.
I planted an apple tree in my yard.
I'm just looking.
The fire consumed the whole house.
He acquired the habit of snacking.
Many young women in their 20s plan to go abroad during their summer holidays.
The train left on time.
Tom fought.
I'm not sure how to pronounce this word.
I don't know where he comes from.
One of my colleagues gave me a gift.
The baby was splashing in the bathtub.
She doesn't speak English as fluently as you.
Did anybody call for security?
What time do you have dinner?
Tom looked very old.
Was the movie interesting?
I usually wear jeans.
It's only when I can't sleep at night that the ticking of the clock bothers me.
Don't give up.
When did you first meet him?
Where is the bathroom?
We live in the United States.
Thank you very much for coming to see me.
This is the first time that I've heard that word.
"You can't say no to Tom, can you?"
Come over to my place.
He is in a poor state of health.
Would 8:30 be convenient for you?
I'm free all afternoon on February 27th.
I can't remember her name.
I was disappointed in her.
Where are you heading?
She went from place to place in search of him.
Her beauty was beyond description.
I ate lunch with Tom.
It will rain tonight.
Tom became an architect.
The woman is reading.
Is anything broken?
Are you still playing the guitar?
Tom is afraid of heights.
Tom was also there.
He turned his coat inside out.
I was deeply moved by that novel.
She glanced through the magazine.
Has he lived here for two years?
"Since there are rice paddies near my house, I often hear frogs croaking all night long this time of year."
What's his most recent novel?
She took part in our project.
Is Tom with you?
I don't have any money.
Let me give you a hint.
"Are you happy, Tom?"

Could I help you?
I have no idea how it works.

I bought a watch and I lost it the next day.
I have something to give you.
Perhaps I should take an umbrella with me just in case.
He is a mathematical genius.
The ground started to shake and the alarm rang.
She is a wonderful woman.
Tom seems to be in love with Mary.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
The police caught the thief.
I am not now in a position to help you.
He's always bad-mouthing his wife.
We're shy.
The bus will arrive at the station in fifteen minutes.
I'm on my way to the station.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
We made it out of there.
Adjust your tie.
"How was 2013 for you, Tom?"
Tom is looking for a job.
Don't lie. Be honest.
I'm free now.

Drivers should wear seat belts.
"Until he comes, I can't go."
I've already eaten breakfast.
Tom has really taught me many things.
He is above suspicion.
I just finished doing it.
"Since it stopped raining, he went out for a walk."
Children will grow even if you leave them alone.
That's especially true right now.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
"I now live in Boston in the US, but I plan to go back to Japan before the end of the year."
His dream finally came true.
What's the temperature now?
I think Tom is still homesick.
She is helping him.
The typhoon did a lot of damage to the crops.
She is off duty tonight.

Give me some coffee if there is any left.
He knows the secret.
There's some milk left.
Are you hurt?
Can I do it again?
I'm very hungry.
A car stopped at the entrance.
Tom is probably asleep.
He is an honest man and will always remain so.
This is one of the reasons that I like Boston.
Shut your mouth.
Tom started playing golf when he was thirteen years old.
"Who kissed Tom first, Mary or Alice?"
You have to push that door to open it.
Tom's died.
I can take care of myself.
Have you found the solution to the problem?
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December.
Mt. Fuji was covered with snow.
He gazed at the ceiling for a long time.

Who's this guy?
You've already told me this story.
I'm curious.
I just want to hug you.
He hid his toys under the bed.
We were granted the privilege of fishing in this bay.
Would you care for another glass of beer?
He still loves her.
Tom is coming back.
I got up at about six.
I think that guys who can play piano are cool.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
How did he react to the bad news?
Her party was really fun.
He delivered a speech.
"I'd rather you didn't, if you don't mind."
He runs a supermarket in the town.
Where's my brother?
He speaks English.
All of them were gone.
We're going to see a foreign film tonight.
Is Tom infected?
Tom is finally safe.
I saw at a glance that he was an ordinary man.
He made his way to the room.
Did you enjoy the game?
Tom is on his way here.
What do you say to calling it a day?
"What do you think, Tom?"
I'm here to see Tom.
I honestly didn't care.
My mother is a very good cook.
Team members are provided with equipment and uniforms.
He fell in love with her.
Let's talk about this later.
There was a large harvest of peaches last year.
Tom got attacked by a dog.
Will it be hot tomorrow?
She walked around looking for him.
He knows New York inside out.
The Rhine runs between France and Germany.
Turn on the light. I can't see anything.
He often writes to his parents in Japan.
She laced her shoes.
I don't have time to explain.
That's a good idea.
We should approach this problem from different angles.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I can have dinner ready by 10 o'clock.
Tom approved.
This is your pilot speaking.
They yelled.
I no longer care.
There are a lot of different people in Europe.
I bought her a nice Christmas present.
Where should we meet tomorrow?
You can come and get it today.
It's 9:15.
Was everybody listening?
Are you afraid of me?
Do you know where your father went?
My children had eaten all the cookies by the time I got home.
I wonder if he will win both races.
She grinned at me when she came into the room.
Tom likes electronic dance music.
Tom was born and raised in Boston.
I'll forgive you just this once.
"Now that I think over it, it's somewhat embarrassing."
I can't bear to see him cry like that.
Where do I have to change trains?
I'm worn out.
Tom has a boat.
Tom has a dangerous job.
French is my native language.
He looks as if he were ill.
"If I'm reincarnated, I want to come back as a cat."
Tell Tom I love him.
"Your room number, please."
I don't for a moment doubt your honesty.
A heavy frost is expected tonight.
The sky was filled with stars.
Beat it.
The tree was ready to fall down.
She turned a page of her book.
The meeting room is occupied at the moment.
I'm very busy.
They understood.
3 to the third power is 27.
Would you like to dance with me?
I want something to drink.
"Oh, please, stop that noise!"
Mother gets up earlier than anybody else in my family.
Do you have anything to declare?
Please raise your hand before you speak.
"Once I started college, I barely had time to sleep."
The meeting will probably be canceled.
I bought a T-shirt.
This door will not open.
Give me the soap.
Call me Tom.
I'll be seventeen next year.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
Do you want something to eat?
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
She sang the song with tears running down her cheeks.
I asked Tom to meet Mary at the station.
Wake Tom up.
"I had been thinking about our new project for two weeks, but I couldn't come up with a good idea."
Is something bothering you?
They are not my real parents.
I think it's getting warmer.

Tell me your story. I am all ears.
I always watch the weather report before going out in the morning.

What's your favorite number?
Do you have any pets?
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

Feel free to ask any questions.
Is it here yet?
Count on me.
Please don't tell this to your parents.

It's not a major problem.
We live in the country during the summer.
I think that I see something.
I'd rather be a bird than a fish.

Do you have a double room?
I work best under pressure.
Poverty is the root of all evil.
She is beginning to play the piano.
What do you think this sentence means?
That isn't necessary.
If only I could sing well.
We can do it.
"How many pumpkins do you want? ""Three, please."""
I'm not like Tom.
She was reluctant to reveal her secret.

I love you the way you are.
I'm really tired.
Tom pulled a flashlight out of his jacket pocket.
I planted this tree three years ago.

Fall is the best season for sports.
I do think that it's a pity.

Switzerland is a beautiful country worth visiting.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
"Take off your socks, please."

Would you mind my opening the window?
Where are you from?
I thought Tom and Mary were going to use me as a hostage.
This isn't Tom's car.
"If you don't hurry, you'll be late."
Tom doesn't want to take such a risk.
Do you have a Christmas vacation in Japan?
I don't think that he's right.
"Tom is very forgetful, isn't he?"
Two heads are better than one.
Let's ask the teacher.

Don't run so fast.
Tom sent Mary money.
How much is it for one person?
Are you saying my life is in danger?
There are some books on the desk.
I'd like to buy a house.
"When I heard it, I was dumbfounded."

You've got plenty of time.
I have mucus coming out of my eyes.

I think Tom is a little too optimistic.
There's no chance Tom will win.
This is never going to end.
I think you should go by taxi.
What do you want to have for lunch?
They moved in just the other day.
Are you still hungry?
Tom stayed silent.
I was there yesterday.
I've just finished lunch.
Tom is just a little nervous.
Calm down.
How many hours a week do you teach?

Tom's head is bandaged.
It's a fact you can't deny.

I don't like to run.
"So Tom, what do you think?"
"Which do you like better, spring or autumn?"

Tom didn't call the police.
I'm on the eighth floor.
Calm down.
Harajuku is one of the hottest places in Tokyo.

You don't have a fever.
The moon came out from behind the clouds.
The tire leaks air.
It's your move.
She's wearing a hat.
She finished reading the letter.
I want Tom to see this.
Are you expecting Tom?
"I hear you quit your job. ""Actually, I got fired."""
Was the work done by him alone?
I'd prefer to not talk about that now.
"Cats are like girls. If they talk to you it's great, but if you try to talk to them, it doesn't go so well."
I had not waited ten minutes before Mary came.
"After Tom explained it in French, he said the same thing in English."
It isn't a serious error.
"When you come to Boston, I'll show you around."
An hour has sixty minutes.

Please answer this question for me.
How come you never told me this before?
How's the weather in Boston?
You should find somebody else to help you.
I hope it's fine tomorrow.
Please tell the truth.
I don't feel like going out tonight.
The adopted child lived a happy life with her new family.
I've decided to study French.
Tom might never walk again.
I brought a suit against the doctor.
I reckon we'll see him once more.
Tom is blind in one eye.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
Are you going out tonight?
My eyes hurt.
I am dying for a cold drink.
I don't understand the meaning of the question.
Can't you stay a little longer?
She is looking for a job where she can make use of her foreign language ability.

Someone must've left the window open.
"Is he seriously ill? ""I hope not."""
Tell me what you want.
Did you buy a return ticket?
Tom seemed like he was about to burst into tears any minute.
Will you notify me after 3 minutes?
I think Tom is going to faint.
I totally agree with what you say.
It's too difficult for me.
I am busy now.
Tom found an empty beer can in his daughter's bedroom.
I lucked out.
He likes ham and eggs.
Keep your voice down.
I'd like to try this on.
It rained three days on end.
She came to Tokyo at the age of 18.
This door would not open no matter what I did.
She gave me a piece of good advice.
There's no point in trying again.
I'm afraid that you have the wrong number.
Is it too much?
I'll be back right away.
One for all and all for one.
Do you have any money?
There are many sights to see in Kyoto.
I got up early in order to catch the first train.
Tom fell off the ladder.
I don't know when he'll be here.
He probably won't become famous.
Can I make a suggestion?
"A beer, please."
We have a lot of snow in the winter.
I'll take the cheapest.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
He was sentenced to death.
Tell me what you did on your holidays.
Maybe it wasn't Tom.
I've never heard her speak ill of others.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
They won.
I had sore legs the next day.
Do we have anything I can snack on?
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
Are there survivors?
He went hunting in the woods.
Is it true you wanted to live in Australia?
Tom went for a swim.
You don't have to apologize.
He is not kind to her.
Please don't make me laugh. I did too many sit-ups yesterday and my stomach muscles hurt.
This is a true story.
I am interested in Asian history.
Please knock before you come in.
I heard a strange sound coming from the room above.
That's my line!

"In 1603, when King James I came into power, football was allowed again."
Is it true that Tom has never been to Boston?

The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Do you know what color she likes?
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
She's a second grader.
Don't get a stomachache by eating too much.
I need some paper.
What did she buy at the shop?
He hid behind the door.
"Turn off the light, please."
I won't tell anybody what you did.
He looks young.
I advised him to be independent of his parents.
You're nuts!
"I play chess, too."
"Welcome home, Tom."
Tom is sound asleep.
Turn off the gas.
Let's wait until six o'clock.
That woman must be his wife.
Few students knew his name.
This is an interesting book.
He is unconscious of his bad manners.
May I ask why?
A crowd gathered at the scene.
He can neither read nor write.
Reading is his chief amusement.
She is having dinner.
He left for London the day before yesterday.
I was just in time for the flight.
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house.
Nobody knows what it is that has been bothering him so much.
She bought a new house the other day.
Some kind of party upstairs kept me up till one last night.
His wife was nowhere to be seen.
"We could have our tea in the garden, were it a little warmer."
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one away.
Tom blew up the balloon.
I'm tired of working a nine-to-five job.
Please help me.
Can you break an egg with one hand?
What is that?
I thought Tom was still in jail.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
We were supposed to leave Boston that night.
"Is there anything you want to tell me, Tom?"
Do you understand?
Please don't buy that.
Do as you're told to do.
An accident has just happened.
Tom said that his knees hurt most of the time.
Tom got sick because he ate too much.
She is not a poet but a novelist.
Please don't leave the city.
We played baseball yesterday.
He can't afford a new car.
The peace talks begin this week.
Never press this button.
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
Our baby isn't talking yet.
The cat likes to sleep beside me.
There was no question about that.
He acquainted himself with his job.
I appreciate you calling me.
"I remember it, too."
May I ask how old you are?
I'm looking forward to the party.
I'm afraid that you have the wrong number.
What do you do in your spare time?
The patient is now out of danger.
He was conspicuous in his suit.
They will be very glad.
I'm afraid that you misunderstood me.
"For the time being, I must share this room with my friend."
I don't know who you want to meet.
The wound left a scar on his arm.
Mary is Tom's stepsister.
My house is old and dilapidated.
Hold still.
I don't think that Tom knows Mary is in the hospital.
He has a habit of sucking his pencil.
What is done cannot be undone.
"Help yourself, please."
We happened to meet at the station.
He has no children.
He's looking good.
Tom arrived at noon.
It may rain in the evening.
Music preferences vary from person to person.
What he said was nothing less than a threat.
Stay with me here.
Why are they laughing?
Tom left home at noon.
They were born in Thailand.
Tom was seen stealing apples from the neighbor's tree.
He caught a chill because he went out in the rain.
That nurse is very kind and polite.
Tom and Mary are great friends.
I like short hair.
Were you going to the train station when I saw you?
You must be polite to your elders.
You work too much.
More than a third of the world population lives near a coast.
When does Tom get back?
We sat at the back of the hall.
The room was cleaned by Tom.
He asked me what I had been doing.
We must buy a new carpet for this room.
He hid it behind the door.
Tom soon adapted himself to school life.
"Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news."
I heard my parents whispering last night.
I am engaged in a new business.
"Beef, please."
I'm an engineer.
I am responsible for her protection.
What do you say to waiting five more minutes?
Tom and I went to the same high school.
"Tom is standing right behind me, isn't he?"
Were you in Boston last week?
My mother boiled ten eggs.
He would wait for hours for her call.
Tom finally got a job.
"I tried to stay on friendly terms with her, but it was impossible."
You must study your whole life.
We will contact you as soon as we know.
You can study here.
Tom quickly ate his breakfast.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
Is there somebody you want to see?
"Except for the storm, I would have arrived earlier."
He put the room in order.
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
I thought you were right.
Her daughter is bad at cooking.
What are you worried about?
Mary bought a skirt and a blouse.
What did you lose?
I'm really tired.

You should study in an efficient manner.
I think Tom is bored.
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
Is this computer connected to the Internet?
She spoke to me in Spanish.
She bought six yards of cloth for a dress.
I made friends with him.
Tom often talks on the phone.
How could Tom be so mean?
Where did you buy that book?
What is your impression of the United States?
There is little hope that he will recover.
I missed the point of the joke.
I appreciate your advice.
Are all the passengers on board?
I want to eat steak.
The bridge between Denmark and Sweden is almost five miles long.
I got home at exactly 2:30.
He was innocent of the crime.
Why is Tom so sleepy?
Her daughter is bad at cooking.
I don't mind even if she doesn't come.
She is after a better job.
Tom returned to Boston on Monday.
"If he could pass for eighteen years old, he'd join the army."
"If you leave your textbooks at school during the break, they'll get confiscated."
He left the house without so much as saying goodbye.
I was surprised to hear the news.
I passed the examination with difficulty.
What am I to do next?
I slept twelve hours yesterday.
Our teacher seldom laughs.
I'm extremely tired.
A dog bit her leg.
He knows nothing about politics.
What else do you have?
Tom did that once.
I persuaded him to consult a doctor.
I could not attend the meeting.
I'd like a book.
Please don't let the children play with knives.
You forgot to turn off the light.
Tom seems to enjoy provoking arguments.
It might be a good idea to get some sleep.
Could you come back here again tomorrow at 2:30?
I wonder whether you understand.
I just moved.
Not many people will come.
I know that Tom is afraid.
I think Tom is hardworking.
Do you really need to go out in this kind of weather?
How much is this ring?
I met Tom in October.
This is my bicycle.
Do you know when they will arrive?
I apologize.
The bananas you brought to me last night were all bad.
It is already eleven.
Don't stand up.
I don't want to go to the circus with Tom.
Tom doesn't know how to tie his shoes.
We have some local wine.
I said drop it!
She appears to have a lot of friends.

Many criminals in America are addicted to drugs.
Why are you always taking Tom's side?
Subtract three from eight and you get five.
Purchase any necessary articles quickly.
Please let us know.
I don't like his affected manner of speaking.
This large sofa would be out of place in a small room.
Who do you work for?
He acts very shy in her presence.
He's smart.
I'm accustomed to getting up early.
When's your birthday?
I had a hard time trying to persuade him to cancel the trip.
I have a lot of patients who are older than me.
See you tomorrow at the library.
A nervous person will not be fit for this job.
I am engaged in AIDS research.
The fog prevented the planes from taking off.
I've decided to study abroad.
I'd like to join your group.
I'm waiting for the train.
The students answered in order.
I've got more money than I know what to do with.
How long will this cold weather continue?
I didn't expect you so soon.
He turned over the business to his son.
Let me see your prescription.
"You know who Tom is, don't you?"
Tom hates being tickled.
I have a lot of homework to do.
Everybody is very busy getting ready for the New Year.
I don't intend to leave it to chance.
She's asking for the impossible.
Do you like fish?
Are you going to let Tom drive?
They sent me a sample in answer to my request.
Tom is right behind me.
You may borrow this book as long as you keep it clean.
We wandered aimlessly around the shopping district.

The odds of this team winning are close to zero.
"After I got married, my Japanese got better and I could understand more."
She achieved great success in her business.
Tom didn't need a new coat.
I like it very much.
"I'll be back in a minute, he added."
What happened?
Do you have classes this Friday?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
These are two nice pictures.
I'll take a nap after lunch.
Is Tom an actor?
She has always been a popular actress.
Lock the door.
Come back soon.
Tom is smiling at the baby.
Let me introduce myself.
You may spend a maximum of 100 dollars.
Tom doesn't know anything about computer programming.
My parents are from Australia.
It shouldn't be like that.
He's always changing his mind.
He put his foot through the floor.
I've seen better days.
Can I borrow $30?
It's incredible!
Let's meet this afternoon.
I'd like to reserve a table for four at six.
I remember reading this novel before.
"When you travel abroad, you usually need a passport."
She doesn't like to leave anything unfinished.
I walk to school every day.
Yesterday I was caught in a shower on my way home from walking in the park.
He was too sleepy to read the evening newspaper.
Are you out of work?
Is it Japanese food?
"At last, the gem was in his hands."
I read a lot.
I am not always free on Sundays.
We finally decided to give him over to the police.
Why are you burning these pictures?
"It's been a while since I've been here, but nothing has changed."
I'm too tired to walk.
He's still young.
It is said that he knows the secret.
Is Tom really that stupid?
I fell asleep while reading.
Where should we go?
"Keep up, Tom."
Do you like white chocolate?
I didn't want this to happen.
That's really a great idea.
Tom opened the window to let in some fresh air.
Tom understood.
I didn't realize that the cost of living was so high in Australia.
I like to eat watermelon.
Are you sure you locked the door?
I just wish we could leave this horrible place.
"We have two spare rooms upstairs, neither of which has been used for years."
I hope that you are very well.
I found it difficult to read the book.
He often swears when he is angry.
She has lost weight.
I corrected myself.
I bought two pairs of trousers.
Water freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade.
The squirrel is climbing the tree.
What's today's plan?
Dogs are smart.
I was mildly disappointed.
Tom resisted the temptation to lean over and kiss Mary.
He took off his hat.
How about adding a little bit more salt?
She is very clever.
Someone is waiting for you downstairs.
He will join us later.
Tom can get in touch with Mary by email.
Now go home.
"She ignored him, which proved unwise."
I'm living with my parents.
Be careful not to trip.
There is nothing wrong with him.
I like movies a lot.
"You're a friend of Tom's, aren't you?"
Everyone dreams.
How's the job hunt going?
I love eggplant.
I'll bet you that you're wrong about that.
Is this water drinkable?
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
I think you ought to rest a while.
"A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him round."
I've been bitten by mosquitos all over my arm.
"How much is this handkerchief? ""It is ninety-five cents."""
Get dressed.
It was handmade.
Tom is out shoveling snow.
Have you ever worked at a restaurant before?
The best is yet to come.
I won't allow it!
Thousands of hectares of tropical rainforest are being lost every day.
That is out of the question.
What line of work are you in?
I haven't seen Tom lately.
Lie down and make yourself comfortable.
I want to be clear about that.
Aren't you asleep yet?
This kind of cat doesn't have a tail.
It's freezing.
The year 1980 saw the fastest economic growth in that country.
I don't like either watch.
Very young children don't know many words.
I'm glad you found the money that you lost.
I got a weird email.
A loud knocking at the door woke him up.
He put the book on the desk.
She looks sad.
Tom bought his mother flowers.
My uncle has been dead for three years.
He went over the house.
Tom is kissing Mary.
You had better not associate with those men.
I have a feeling I've been here before.
Tom is interested in learning French.
Don't change horses midstream.
He was experienced in business.
Which side of the plate is the spoon supposed to be on?
I'm up.
My sister will get married early next year.
Tom himself was ecstatic.
Spring is the best season to visit Kyoto.
I've got something I really have to do.
I'm anxious to succeed.
We must leave right away.
Tom does not like cheese.
I wonder what happened.
She looks happy.
Don't do anything rash.
He recommended that I go there.
We left the door open.
Tom always wears blue shirts.
What'll you do after graduation?
I tried in vain to open it.
You had plenty of time.
She's unconscious.
The police caught the burglar red-handed.
Mind your own business.
Would you please shut the windows?
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
The girl was aware of the danger.
He's three years older than she is.
I didn't mean to give you that impression.
This medicine should make you feel better.
I think you should stop smoking.
Are you still sick?
My shoes are too small. I need new ones.
The ticket is good for three days.
Tom is in favor of gun control.
There is a book on the desk.
I'd like to send these to Japan.
It's entirely my fault.
Can you explain this?
It looks like those two have gotten back together.
Thank you for your concern.
"He's a famous physicist not only in Japan, but throughout the world."
She's in the hospital now.
I had a fight with my older brother yesterday.
What did you answer?
I have been busy this week.
There is a lake in front of my house.
I'm at a loss for words.
Apes rank above dogs in intelligence.
What're you waiting for?
I'm sorry to always be bothering you.
How did Tom find us?
Tom kicked the trash can.
I make it a rule never to borrow money.
We don't have any extra money.
I'm much younger than Tom.
They must've had an accident.
Tom is in the hospital.
Are you open on Sunday?
I've decided to go to Boston.
Wait a bit.
I'm not the least bit worried about it.
It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
"Entering the house, I tripped over the mat."
I'd like to go to college.
She bought him some candy.
I like coffee hot.
I didn't like beer at that time.
I decided to study abroad.
"In 2009, Selena Gomez became the youngest person to be named a United Nations Children's Fund Ambassador in the United States."
He could always tell which direction the wind was blowing.
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.
Tom was arrested for driving without a license.
She is always busy.
I'm not interested.
Please don't move.
"If you push the button, the door will open."
Could you help me solve this problem?
She looked up at the ceiling.
I must open the window.
Have you ever been kicked out of a bar?
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
Let's hear about it.
May his soul rest in peace.
They must have suspected me of stealing.
He is the last man I want to see.
I was fined 20 dollars for illegal parking.
Will it rain tomorrow?
Are you going to write to Tom?
Tom isn't good at sports.
I'm glad to hear of your success.
I want some water.
Guns don't kill people. People kill people.
My mother will attend to the baby while I go to the dance.
This is what I found in the cave.
You're very cute.
Here it is.
Tom left about thirty minutes ago.
The police have blocked off the area.
Are Tom and Mary really engaged?
I took the elevator to the fourth floor.
They hugged each other.
Please put the chair away. It is in the way.
I just couldn't say no.
"If you like Tom so much, why not break up with me and date him?"
"What with the wind and the rain, our walk was spoiled."
Almost all the doors were closed.
My son is now as tall as I am.
I can't stand it that she's suffering so.
Are you sure?
I'd like to cancel my appointment for June first.
Water is scarce in this area.
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
Do what you like.
I'm disappointed my friend isn't here.
"What's important isn't how many books you read, but what books you read."
Tom isn't able to speak French.
Did you give the key to Tom?
I never thought that day would come.
My grandfather gave me a birthday present.
He advised us against doing it.
Don't disappoint me the way you did the other day.
I don't know the reason for her absence.
Both Tom and Mary should get some sleep.
I got an ink blot on this form.
I am no longer tired.
She is very intelligent.
Is there room at the counter?
The dog next door is always barking.
The flood was the greatest disaster they had ever had.
I have to open the window.
I work out.
"I'm talking about this pen, not that one over there on the desk."
The professor encouraged me in my studies.
Come home before it gets dark.
I have no pain in particular.
He gave up cigarettes.
Tom never stops to think.
I am happy.
Wait just a moment.
It's not easy for me.
I will play tennis this afternoon.
I'll go meet him soon.
He has a strong sense of responsibility.
Is this Tom's office?
"May I help you? ""No, thank you. I'm just looking."""
Mind your own business.
I bet Tom would be a good teacher.
"Don't worry, I'll help you."
I got sick from drinking too much.
I've just finished lunch.
"To be honest, I don't like you at all."
The student left without saying anything.
Tom is just my age.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
My computer won't boot up.
I'm very sorry.
Do you know whether or not she can speak English?
Leave it to me. I'll see to it.
Tom told me I walked like a penguin.
Would you please have a look at this document?
That's OK.
He's away on business.
We talked the plan over with him.
Was that an earthquake?
"Come on, spit it out!"
"They left at 5 o'clock, so they ought to be home by 6."
I have a cut here.
I have expected his death for six months.
The table is wobbling.
I can see that.
How did you get acquainted with her?
I don't think we need to worry.
I have a nice golden fountain pen.
You cannot get blood out of a stone.
"It would be good to sleep, even for just a little bit."
The forest was very still.
I don't know where I should go.
Her house is at the foot of a mountain.
I have low blood pressure.
I was too surprised to speak.
Tom is a good captain.
Is there anything that I can do to help you?
I will be with you right away.
I will show you around the city.
Where's the cafeteria?
She was scared by the big earthquake.
How's married life?
Tom and Mary were always together.
Her son is a genius.
They didn't swim because it was cold.
His dream has come true.
This window won't open.
Where do you come from?
I looked for the key.
I had my wallet stolen on the bus.
Can you help me translate this into French?
He's a volleyball player.
He called my name.
Tom and Mary fight all the time.
There is going to be a storm.
My mom is proud of me.
Have you already eaten some cake?
Is Tom still swimming?
He put on the red jacket.
"If it had not been for your foolishness, we would never have been in that trouble."
I don't know what that is.
We had a good deal of rain last summer.
"Which do you speak more often, French or English?"
Two little girls are picking daisies.
I wonder whose scissors these are.
Are you absolutely sure this is Tom's house?
This room gets sunshine.
Tom couldn't eat for three days.
That hit the spot.
Wait one moment.
Are you surprised?
"A cup of coffee, please."
Please speak in a low voice.
Don't come unless I tell you to.
My father has gone out to buy postcards.
We'd like to speak with Tom.
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
I'll open the curtain for you to look out.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Tom was shocked to hear that Mary had died.
How long will it take to get well?
Tom asked me how to get to Mary's house.
We should make every effort to maintain world peace.
It is dangerous to play in the street.
"When we started out, there were things we didn't know."
"If you don't want to get married, it would be better if you didn't get married."
There's a little wind.
I asked him if he would help me.
Please tell me the truth.
He accumulated his fortune by hard work.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
He is supposed to be at home today.
Who broke this?
Where's the nearest train station?
I pushed my bicycle home.
He finished his work.
Where does it hurt?
I take a bath every night.
He wrote the report.
He is often absent from school.
I'm twice your age.
Did the umbrella that you found belong to Tom?
He was disappointed that things didn't turn out as he'd hoped.
I hope that Tom will never do that again.
"This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it."
She accused him of stealing her car.
Tell me what happened.
She must have everything her own way.
Those kids know that.
It's so rare.
Please don't forget to put out the fire before you go home.
He was a professor at Cambridge University.
I'll show you how to catch a fish.
Tom told Mary what he'd done.
I bought a wonderful watch for her.
I'm a salesman.
Tom always gets lost if he doesn't carry a map.
Don't be angry.
Tom forgot to take his umbrella with him.
She is dear to me.
Don't you love me anymore?
I'm not Catholic.
They're studying French and web design.
She has seven sons.
Just look at him.
"What are you doing, Dad?"
The speed of the spread of AIDS is horrifyingly fast.
Tom certainly sounds like he comes from a rich family.
I'll go with you as far as the bridge.
Tom pretended to be Mary's friend.
My husband is a very good cook.
The dog barked.
I'm not very good at remembering names.
This bicycle is mine.
No problem at all!
I won't be able to finish if you don't help me.
You can get a car license after you turn eighteen.
How much is that?
The flowers are opening.
He encountered a friend on the road.
He's been staying at that hotel for the past five days.
This building has three floors.
It began to rain before I got home.
Do you dream in French?
Tom drove.
Tom gave John some of his clothes.
"Turn on the light, please."
"How old are you? ""I'm sixteen."""
He was too tired to go any farther.
You can search for his number in this telephone book.
What happened? You look pale.
Is it true Tom's father is famous?
He introduced his sister to me.
I saw you with a tall boy.
I'm not used to getting up early.
She made the same mistake as before.
I'm happy to see you again.
Can you give me a lift to the station?
"Don't just stand there, say something."
Many people think that children spend too much time watching television.
There is a bus every 20 minutes.
"Did Tom, by any chance, let Mary drive the car?"
I asked him if he would go there the next day.
These socks do not match.
You will soon get to like her.
I will do it myself.
Mary goes to that restaurant for lunch every other day.
I'm at my wit's end.
Does it hurt when I do this?
It is up to you.
That's not very nice.
He was wounded in the head.
Tom wasn't able to do what he wanted to do.
Tom grabbed his coat.
Today is Saturday.
I fell down the stairs.
She disappeared in the dark.
Tom isn't scared to die.
I don't think you should be doing that.
Do I really have to give a speech?
There were ink blots on the paper.
Lasagna is one of my favorite foods.
Are you still playing golf?
I wonder what I should get you for your birthday.
He has acted on TV many times.
Take a look at this map.
"I don't think it will rain, but I'll take an umbrella just in case."
What time are we leaving?
I haven't seen you in ages.
She didn't attend the meeting for fear of meeting her ex-husband.
His story sounds true.
Will he be able to catch the train?
The waitress put a white tablecloth on the table.
English is like a universal language.
Is there anything to drink in the refrigerator?
Do you have a car?
Tom tried to sing Mary to sleep.
Can't you hear the sound?
Please tell me which bus to take to go downtown.
Please be sure to take one dose three times a day.
You may injure yourself if you don't follow safety procedures.
The cost of living increased dramatically.
Call me at the office tomorrow morning.
"If only I had a map, I could show you the way."
"The longer I stayed in Paris, the more I liked it."
"Finally, he attained his goal."
You can ask him for help.
There's no limit.
He accommodated me with a night's lodging.
Boys always want to play football after school.
Did you study hard in high school?
She went home.
The cherry blossoms are at their best.
The pain was such that I was not able to sleep.
Are you allergic to any medications?
This is too long.
Everybody looked up to him.
My nose is running.
I haven't heard from her for a long time.
This book seemed interesting.
They're always having trouble with their word processor.
I don't know how to cook too many things.
I never asked for this.
I need to know by tomorrow.
You're a true friend.
I am not quite sure if we can meet your requirements.
She is going to learn how to drive.
I have fifteen hundred cows.
Our debt is more than we can pay.
Take a seat. You look tired.
You can have this book for nothing.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
"Tom was on a diet, so all he ate for dessert was one strawberry."
She acknowledged his help in her book.
You're on the path to success.
Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep.
He lives in a very small room.
Go home quickly.
Some apples rotted on the tree.
It's a firefly.
She cremated him against his wishes.
It's a firefly.
I'm afraid that I can't afford to buy a new car.
"I like you, but not in a romantic way."
Tom cried.
This book is very heavy.
You've done it!
The reason that Tom got sick was because he overate.
Whose is this bicycle?
Almost everyone that I know can speak French.
Give them to her.
Few people understood his comment.
I had him repair my watch.
That country is about twice as large as Japan.
I think Tom is exaggerating.
I have been acquainted with her for more than 20 years.
I don't want dinner.
Tom thinks it impossible for Mary to break the record.
Health is the most precious thing we have.
Please don't look at your cellphone while we're eating.
The group departed as soon as he arrived.
Tom laid the bat on the ground.
She assumed an air of indifference.
Is it safe to eat a pig's eyeball?
He stayed up late last night.
This book is very thick.
I am very pleased to hear the news.
I am a Japanese.
He was wearing glasses.
Rest assured that I will do my best.
I don't want to be a doctor.
Don't watch too much TV.
I got up late this morning.
Has he returned yet?
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
Stay home.
He was tired from his long walk.
Is it easy to install?
How did you meet your wife?
Forgive Tom.
"This textbook, having been printed in haste, has a lot of printing mistakes."
The snow has disappeared.
Why do you ask?
"According to the paper, it will snow tomorrow."
I can do it today.
I don't know anything.
Would you like to hear the story about Paul Bunyan?
Tom has small hands.
"Mother, I'm sorry for causing you trouble all the time."
I'm going to Tom's house tomorrow.
You may go ahead and open the window if you want to.
My mother went to the department store to do some shopping.
You shouldn't let children play with the kitchen knife.
Do you think that my way of teaching is wrong?
I was able to answer all the questions.
"In those days, I used to get up at six every morning."
He succeeded.
Can you wait a minute?
She's worried about your safety.
I'm looking for a house.
Are you calling me a thief?
"He's reigning champion, and no young challenger is going to take it away from him."
He got lost in the city.
Tom was born on a plane.
Traditional Japanese sweets really do go well with Japanese tea.
The foreigner spoke Japanese as if it were her mother tongue.
I don't know what you want me to do.
Tom doesn't need to wear glasses anymore.
Tom started to cry.
She's fashionable.
I'm likely to get home late tonight.
There were quite a few passengers on board.
I'm free.
Please hurry.
This is what I want.
He is tremendously handsome.
"The moment she saw me, she burst into tears."
I prefer coffee to tea.
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
You should begin with easier questions.
I cleared the table.
We have enough time to catch the train.
I thought that I recognized Tom.
I'm faithful to my wife.
It was obvious that the driver had not been careful enough.
Let me try it.
We have a little time before the next train.
I think this is a great system.
You should keep your promises.
Tell Tom I said hi.
We were just talking about you when you called.
Please come whenever you like.
The house burned down completely.
Both Tom and Mary like old movies.
Everyone knows about Tom.
Look in your spam folder.
Just shut up.
He can't count.
It's too dark to play outside.

Tom shouldn't have told me.
He has never been late for school.
"It's not what he said, but the way he said it."
The sheriff beat the suspect until he was almost dead.
I don't like these kinds of jokes.
We'll meet at the station at 2:30.
I did that without consulting anyone.
Tom isn't really good at tennis.
These books are old.
I thought that you'd speak French better than Tom.
Is Tom in a good mood?
They were swimming.
I am afraid I ate something bad.
Tom forgot his umbrella.
Is that just a coincidence?
I remember seeing her before.
I didn't know how to express myself.
He explained it in detail.
Tom showed me how to do it.
He is afraid of death.
What's your favorite animal?
"Some fish live in rivers, others in the sea."
We saw the parade move down the street.
Are you through with your breakfast?
I don't care how you do it. Just do it.
The good way to know a foreign country is to go there.
Will you help me pick out a tie to go with this suit?
Please accept my sincere apologies.
Don't call me when I'm at the office.
The news of his son's death was a great shock.
He was just on the verge of going to sleep.
I'm very short of money.
She made him a new suit.
He could not accept a strange woman as his mother.
I didn't buy anything at the duty-free shops.
Were you at the party?
"Who do you think is cuter, Mary or Alice?"
"Tom is sick, isn't he?"
He caught sight of a ship in the distance.
The population is increasing.
Our city is rather small in comparison with Tokyo.
Tom is a math nerd.
He grits his teeth and forces back his growing fear.
My blood pressure is low.
What do you say to going out for a short walk?
You should've called me.
Don't cry. Crying doesn't solve anything.
What kind of work will you do?
Everybody knows two and two make four.
She is a slow runner.
She made a new dress for her daughter.
I slept just two hours.
I took off my coat because it was hot.
I do think so.
Are you still working with Tom?
I was trying to kill time.
She loves coffee.
"You're good at speaking French, aren't you?"
"I thought about throwing it away, but decided to keep it."
How soon do you need it?
Tom felt a bit tired.
I don't want to go outside this afternoon.
The plane arrived exactly at nine.
Give it another shot.
I ran as fast as possible.
All we can do is wait for the police to arrive.
Can you answer this?
"Hold on, please."
The boy clasped the puppy to his chest.
My hair is so messy!
She has three brothers.
He left Africa forever.
Please come here at 3 o'clock precisely.
I don't know where Tom's socks are.
Could you turn down the radio?
It isn't important.
The soap hurt my eyes.
His argument was logical.
He did not get up early.
Play outside instead of watching TV.
The captain is responsible for the safety of passengers.
He stared at me.
Thank you.
The second showing will start soon.

I like this coat. May I try it on?
You should quit smoking.
Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
Would you like a cup of milk?
I don't sleep well.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Can I use MasterCard here?
I'm rather proud of it.
I think it makes sense.
The only thing Tom needs now is a little patience.
What is your favorite sport?
He quickly scanned my manuscript.
Is it snowing now in Boston?
Why can't Tom come?
He became irritated.
How long is this bridge?
You should eat more.
Wow! It's been a long time.
I ate three donuts.
A boy came running toward me.
We met in Boston.
Tom didn't have any children.
He's studying hard so he can pass the entrance exam.
What if someone sees us?
There is no time to lose.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
Is this Tom's umbrella?
I won't do to Tom what he did to me.
I don't see anything.
May I borrow your dictionary?
I don't drink beer very often.
This hat is too tight for me.
What's eating you?
Get your homework done as soon as you can.
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
"You'll have this composition written by noon tomorrow, won't you?"
Eat wherever you want.
This is just what I wanted.
You don't need to be in that much of a hurry.
Wait just a moment.
Go to sleep.
Thank you for the present.
She drank a cup of milk.
Goodnight.
Modern technology has made our lives more comfortable.
The next station is where you get off.

What's happened?
This is why I hate him.
She goes to the supermarket every three days.
Mary spread the big map on the table.
The hunting dogs followed the scent of the fox.
I'm in charge.
Let's forget about what happened today.
"Thanks for the help. ""Don't mention it."""
I was too astonished to speak.
"The children were walking along, singing a song."
She picked flowers in the garden.
One who is not willing to learn is not worth teaching.
Is Tom still playing outside?
One drop of the poison is enough to kill 160 people.
"You're lying, aren't you?"
"How would you translate this sentence, Tom?"
He disguised himself as a woman.
Perhaps Tom doesn't understand French.
I was able to swim well when I was a child.
She was able to go to college thanks to the scholarship.
Tom knows that I wouldn't cry.
They called on us to do something to help the victims.
"I've been back for a week, but I'm still suffering from jet lag."
He's over thirty.
What did you just say?
Is that Tom's bedroom?
They called.
Speaking foreign languages isn't easy.
What are you going to be in the future?
It's all right!
Close your eyes.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
Is this store open on Sundays?
Tom bought a used Toyota.
My new dress is red.
Carry this.
I agree with you to a degree.
Give me some milk.
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
I can see a lady and two dogs in the car.
The situation is worse than I'd thought.
I'll take you up on that.
Let the game begin.
Do you remember who I am?
Scorpions are dangerous.
Were you excited?
Tom understood exactly what Mary wanted him to do.
He walks to school.
I changed my profile picture.
What a relief!
How have you been?
Staying home isn't fun.
I have no time to engage in gossip.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
Can we tag along?
Is that so surprising?
I can't put up with that noise.
Don't overdo it.
Tell me the truth.
I'll send my mother a letter.
No one lives in that house.
Hope you had a good birthday.
Might is right.
He likes coffee without sugar.
I can't take another step.
Tom found the letter Mary had hidden.
I don't feel like going out this morning.
I need to borrow three hundred dollars.
"Speaking of foreign languages, do you speak French?"
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
I'm not going to tell you where Tom is.
I used to go to church on Sunday.
Tom and Mary are both in their thirties.

He took a step forward.
It might rain tomorrow.
My brother leaves his room in a mess.
Tom plays the guitar almost as well as Mary.
It's started snowing.
Thank you for the explanation.
Would you stop staring at me?
Why do I need to learn French?
I think it tastes good.
His face is known to many people.
It would've been nice if you'd helped me a little.
Tom isn't so tall.
I hope to visit Boston again.
I went shopping with a friend.
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
Tom found the letters that Mary had hidden.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
Do you have a part time job?
Tom gave Mary a kiss on both cheeks.
What'll you drink?
"Whenever I hear that song, I think of my younger days."
Do you need much money?
I like going for a walk in the park.
Karaoke is good for reducing stress.
I like classical music.
His brother is more patient than he is.
Do you have time to talk?
The cold weather lasted for three weeks.
We're not interested in such details.
Tom has a brother who is an architect.
I hope to become a singer.
I got sunburned.
Lots of herons live in the marsh.
Tom is wearing a name tag.
I have a sore throat and runny nose.
Tom used to go to Boston a lot.
Where do you live?
The train rolled out of the station.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
I told you that was just a joke.
"If you mail it by 7:00 p.m., it'll arrive tomorrow."
What he said was over my head.
Are you a student?
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
I'm much younger than Tom is.
I have dry skin.
He came out of the room.
"I think if I talked more often with a native speaker, my English skills would improve quickly."
No problem!
Are you and Tom friends?
How much is this watch?
Are you sleeping?
We're not watching.
I need a new bicycle.
"If I had enough money, I could buy this camera."
"While living near the beach, I often enjoyed swimming."
I have a friend whose father is a magician.
The submarine's periscope was sticking right out of the water.
I don't feel like telling her about it.
We have two sons.
Are you still scared?
I have to go even if it rains.
"In Sendai, we have lots of rain in July."
Will you have another cup of tea?
I have something else to do.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
I drank the coffee.
Tom was involved in a traffic accident.
We saw a dim light in the distance.
"If you could only speak English, you would be perfect."
Stop acting like a child.
Will you pick me up at seven tomorrow morning?
The apples are ripe.
Tom can't seem to keep out of trouble.
"Do you like traveling? ""Yes, I do."""
It's none of your business.
Someone came ten minutes ago.
Will the train leave on time?
He went up Mt. Fuji.
You must adapt to a variety of conditions.
I hardly ever walk to work.
I can't eat any more.
Tom loves Mary with all his heart.
She has consented to take the leadership of the party.
I'll be back by seven or eight o'clock.
It was a huge success.
"After spending three weeks looking for a job, he found a well-paid one."
Tom looked like he was bored.
The whale is a very large mammal which lives in the sea.
He was sitting there.
I've lied to Tom.
Please write back soon.
Nobody knows how to do that.
She taught him how to play the piano.
He seems to have no sense of humor.
Man is the only animal that writes books.
How come you're so busy?
I miss Tom.
Would you please wait for a few minutes?
Go away. I want to be alone.
"What's wrong? ""I don't have a key."""
I think Tom is a bit too impatient.
I didn't expect such a nice present from you.
It's already cleared up.
"To put it bluntly, the reason this team won't win is because you're holding them back."
I still think Tom is hiding something.
He cleared his throat before starting the lecture.
"That's cheap, isn't it?"
Does Tom have kids?
He is a good swimmer.
Are you really going to do that?
I am familiar with the author's name.
She says she has no intention of having a baby until she's in her thirties.
She's driving them to school.
There's a secret passage on the left.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
I'm mad at Tom.
They caught him stealing.
Let's play baseball when the rain stops.
My sister likes melons and so do I.
I suspect Tom and Mary are broke.
She had some trouble with him before.
The alligator ate the dog.
He didn't attend the meeting.
May I make a suggestion?
I hope you'll like it.
Go when you want.
Stop talking about that.
My grandfather is very fond of reading.
It's not easy to believe.
Please open this box.
How often have you been there?
I have been studying German for two years.
I can't remember where we did that.
When will we get there?
I don't think doing that is necessary.
Does Tom need to stay home today?
We will leave in an hour.
He is unpopular for some reason.
Tom is crying.
This room can hold three hundred people.
This problem is too difficult for grade school children to solve.
He has bad eyes.
Lie down on your left side.
Tulips are in full bloom now.
They were shoveling the snow away.
I'll ask Tom.
I'm able to run.

I am looking forward to receiving your favorable answer.
We're getting out of here. The cops are coming.
Can you play a musical instrument?
Can you still eat food that's fallen on the floor?
I have a sore throat.

How's your new job going?
I saw nothing at all.
That's strange.
Tom is intelligent.
"I tried to be calm, but finally I lost my temper."
I awoke to find it snowing.
I still really like it.
There was an accident at the intersection.
"If you want a new bike, you'd better start saving up."
He said he had come to Japan the previous week.
I thought going out to eat together would cheer you up.
I wish Tom would learn to speak French.
That's a very difficult question.
I married off my daughter.
They replaced the broken television with a new one.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't know the answer.
Drive carefully.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
I want to wash my hair.
"Tom, have you already eaten lunch?"
Do you have a question?
Is Tom still hanging around the office?
He invited me to his house.

Mary was kidnapped by pirates.
"Frankly speaking, his speeches are always dull."
My husband and daughter are fast asleep.

What should I do? I said to myself.
Have a nice day.
"I can afford one, but not both."
What's the name of your dog?
I'll bring you the bill immediately.
How long would it take?
Possibly the factory will be closed down next week.

Come here quickly.
This school has many students.
He ran so he would get there on time.

I thought you were going to keep Tom occupied.
Something must have happened to him on the way.
"Tom thought Mary was joking, but she was very serious."
I really like you.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
He had no difficulty explaining the mystery.

Are you feeling under the weather?
She saw him smile.
"Every morning, I go shopping."
Neither Tom nor Mary plays the clarinet.
"Is she coming, too?"

Tom was talking louder than he needed to.
We're in a rush.
Keep the door closed.

That has nothing to do with him.
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
She is a late riser.

I found the room empty.
No one can match him in English.
Hold on firmly to the handrail.

Are you hurt?
Shut the door tight.
He deemed it wise to accept the offer.
Please feel free to link to my page.
You have three cats.
I'll show you the way.

We must keep a diary every day.
Changing outside is embarrassing.
"In our society, there are both honorable people and swindlers."
Is there any food?
You must go through with your plan.

Are you really awake?
The problem is not so much the cost as the time.
Tom couldn't believe that nobody laughed at his jokes.
Tom was a professional gambler before he met Mary.
Don't go.
You don't know who I am.
Tell me what you're arguing about.
He prefers French to German.
"These flowers aren't only beautiful, but they smell nice."
I hate it when I work late and end up missing an episode of a show I'm following.

Put some paper in the copy machine.
Was that intentional?

I sometimes go to Boston.

I'd like to try on this dress.
Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

How should I eat this?
He went to Tokyo with the dream of becoming rich.
She is good at swimming.
How about another glass of wine?
I am supposed to meet him at four.
It's nearly lunchtime. Why don't we stop to have a bite to eat?
Get out of the way.
My eyes feel irritated.
"Sorry, I've got my hands full now."
What does Tom do in Boston?
Would you join me for a walk?
Do you mind if I smoke?
I used to often take walks along that river.
Tom turned the lights on.
I can't do this.
He's a fine young man.
Tom said that he's never eaten sushi.
I'll graduate this year.

I can't understand what you're saying.
This isn't the first time that this has happened.
She is good-natured.
We're in Boston.
He shot at me.
Calm down.
I've changed my mind.
I'm prepared to die.
It is too expensive.
Thank you for your consideration.
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
"Seen from a distance, the stone looks like a human face."
I think that Tom should eat more.

I don't know the exact place I was born.
Is this for me?
I have a very old stamp.
Tom is a phys ed teacher.
I'd prefer to not talk about that here.
Tom folded up his umbrella.
Does it snow much in the winter?
He wouldn't let anybody interfere with his private affairs.
"Can I leave a message, please?"
I can't understand this sign's meaning.
Oh my gosh! You're the last person I expected to meet in a situation like this.
Is this really what you want to do?

Today was an awful day.
I need to send a fax.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
I awoke to find a burglar in my room.
Your house is fantastic.
We were younger then.
The cause of the fire isn't known.
"Just a moment, please."
I bought it last week.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.
It was not until this year that these documents were made available to the public.
Do you like English?
What should I do?
I think I'll go and take a bath.
Please behave prudently.
He is nice.
"If you had not eaten so much, you would not be so sleepy now."

"Now that Father is gone, we can talk freely."
I'm leaving now.
We found out that he was her father.
I met Tom tonight.
Tom sent Mary home.
Tom thought that Mary loved him.
He became irritated.
Can you get it repaired?
Remember to answer his letter.
"I like French, but I can't speak it well."
A lot of time was wasted.
Today is Monday.
I've got to get some shots.
He looks very sleepy.
That was all Greek to me.
My grandfather was always grumbling about something or other.
I'm only here for the weekend.
Are your bags packed?

That's the spirit.

I wish I had dimples.
I have a terrible pain.

How long have you been working here?
Tom doesn't realize how lucky he is.
Haven't you said too much?
Is that the teacher?
We got involved in a traffic accident.
Don't you feel cold?
What's the matter?
I had him take my suitcase to the room.
It is said that global warming is directly related to carbon dioxide emissions.
"If I knew his address, I would write to him."

How did you get to know that person?
I don't come back here very often.
Should I wait for you here?
Could I have a cup of coffee?
Tom can hardly fit into the jeans he bought last year.
This bag is too heavy.
Was there something you wanted to say?
I forgot to lock the storeroom.
He's my most interesting friend.
The town is accessible by rail.
"Excuse me, how much is this?"

Give me three minutes.
Come over here.
I hate politics.
Our section chief always makes a face at me when I ask him for something.
He is fond of swimming.
Can you make it?
I think it's best if you tell Tom.

I don't like you anymore.
Tom had a bottle of poison in his briefcase.
Bring your computer.
You need to take care of the dog.

That's very helpful.
I was convinced that he was guilty.
"Just between you and me, do you love my sister?"
"After the storm, it was calm."
About how much money do you need?
Tom doesn't like Mary.
That helps a lot.
Tom was right behind Mary.
Why did you cry?
She dumped him for a richer man.
It sounds good.
Are you bringing your camera?
My mother is making dinner.
Tom depends on Mary too much.

Mary is the only woman that I've ever really loved.
I'll give you a shot.
I'm not able to fix the car by myself.
"Are you still mad at me? ""No, not at all."""
I wish Tom would weed the garden.
I guess there was some talk of that.
Could you please pass me the pepper?

He told the truth.
That was a very beautiful flower.
It's almost time.
Can you tie a tie?

A rustling sound came from upstairs where nobody should've been.
I'll think it over.
This dress is too big for me.
Tom thought it would be a good idea if Mary got a gun.
Do you have a question?
It isn't always easy to know a good book from a bad one.
These are cakes that she baked herself.
It isn't mine.
Books were lying about in the room.
Please wait a bit.
I am glad it was someone else who got it.

She put on her hat.
I looked in the cupboard.
Tom has come back home from Boston.
You have to answer all of these questions.
The blood on the road must be mine.
Tom kissed Mary on her forehead.
I hear you've done some pretty extreme stuff.
I have a few friends in the United States.
I understand.
That isn't exactly what I said.
Many people were killed as a result of the storm.
Are they brothers?
Did you sew this by hand?
Tom's my cousin.
Was Tom the one who broke the window?
You must return the book by the end of April.
Do you know where he lives?
You shouldn't have made such a remark even if you had been angry.
We've arrived.
The blue lines on the map represent rivers.
"I'll leave tomorrow, weather permitting."
He is nasty.
You did well not to follow his advice.
The most dangerous thing Tom ever tried to do was bungee jumping.
The force of the wind made it difficult to walk.

That can't possibly be true.
The town was full of activity.

Is something wrong with you?
Are all the windows locked?
He's the novelist I admire the most.

My favorite fish is salmon.
He has been barred from the club.
She stopped talking.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
There is no need for her to work.
I got this bicycle for free.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
Moderate exercise will refresh both mind and body.
Are you looking for something?
He goes in for the examination next month.
Where do you come from?
Tom tore the picture into pieces.

He went in place of me.
I want to become better at managing my time.
This coat does not fit me any more.
Take care!
All the schools are closed on that holiday.
It's the dynamic interaction between the characters that makes this novel so great.
Never tell lies.
"If you aren't interested, you don't have to read it."
I'd like you to look after my dog while I'm away.
Do you often come here?
When did you come to Japan?
Would you like to go to the park later this afternoon?
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
Tom was the only one hurt.
Is it OK if I use that?
"Don't quote me on this, but I agree with you."
I have no ear for music.
Do you know where Tom is going?
Is my French really that bad?
He is a rude person.
Tom is now learning to ride a tricycle.

Who sang this song?
Are you still willing to help?
Are you really OK?
All that you have to do is to follow his advice.

He knows everything that there is to know about jazz.

"After that, he went home."
Please refrain from smoking here.
"You have no idea what this is, do you?"
"If you could assist me, it would be a great help."

I sat in the front of the bus.
Use your head for a change.
My ears are ringing.

He bought a small house in Kyoto.
I had to make a speech at short notice.
I took it for granted that she would come to our wedding.
The smoke alarm has never been maintained.

It looks like those two have made up.
Don't be afraid to make mistakes when speaking English.

When will the party take place?
Is Tom lying about his age?
Will we be safe here?
Are you making friends here?
She handed him the key.
It was civil of him to offer his seat to the old man.
I am fond of music.
That's a great plan.
Do you offer any half-day tours?
I want to have a cup of coffee.
Thanks a bunch.
How long have you been dating?
I can't turn the shower off. Could you check it for me?
I like sashimi.
She's trying to repaint her house.
He's always burning the midnight oil.
You do that and I'll fire you.
Just say yes or no.
I am just going for a walk.
This was meant as a joke.
That's enough for today.
Please close the door.
We went to Boston.
He always sings in the shower.
The road is too narrow for cars.
Who ordered pizza?
She isn't running.
I received a letter from her.
Don't surprise me like that.
3 multiplied by 5 is 15.
I'm glad that you're OK.
"What would you do in a situation like this, Tom?"
How long will you be here?
"Move along, please."
"If you want to go to the art museum, take this bus."
There isn't much difference between the two.
You're all bark and no bite.
I can't speak Japanese.
"Because I do not have children, I can spend more time volunteering than parents can."
I'm going to open a pizzeria.
It's extremely cold today.
I like reading mystery novels.
He came back soon.
I didn't know that you were such a good cook.
I've got to go now.
"While in London, he visited the British Museum."
I can't do without a coat in the winter.
The box is covered with a large sheet of paper.
Whose bicycle is this?
I wrote a long email to Tom.
Are you spending Christmas with Tom?
"It was cloudy, so I took an umbrella with me."
Do you want some help?
There were plenty of choices.
He's just like a baby.
The shower doesn't work.
I feel like throwing up.
He's a big show-off when girls are around.
I eat everything.
I know Tom has gone to Boston.
Today is Independence Day.
Tom returned to Boston.
The mountain is covered with snow all the year round.
"When I look back upon those days, it all seems like a dream."
She accommodated her schedule to his.
I'll show you around the town.
Quite a few people were invited to the ceremony.
I can't start up my computer. What am I supposed to do?
"Since the rain stopped, they resumed the game."
It takes twenty minutes to walk from the station to school.
I'm afraid that I might make you angry.
Is Tom left-handed?
He was calm in the presence of danger.
I have many coins in this box.
I'll stop by the post office on the way home.
He caught three fish.
I felt like running away.
A trip by boat takes longer than by car.
Tom couldn't answer all the questions.
The storm stopped the train.
I like to eat apples.
He didn't want to talk about it further.
"I'm not sure yet, but I think I'll become a teacher."
Which one do you think is correct?
The weather was ideal.
I don't like music as much as you do.
He likes adventure.
Could you give me a better price?
I'll take care of the dog while you are out.
She accused him of stealing her money.
I wish I had a beautiful girlfriend.
I think that it was probably last Friday.
In what kinds of situations would you use it?
Does Tom work here in Boston?
I passed the test with flying colors.
Where's the nearest church?
My grandma has gotten very old.
Something's wrong with the engine.
It's not a joke.
We will do anything for you.
It was for Tom and Mary.
She was obliged to give up the plan.
Selling cars is my job.
Don't be long.
We tried to cheer him up by taking him out.
I'm sure you'll like it.
We know that that's not true.
This book deals with psychology.
I wish I had a reason not to go.
Tom and Mary built a snowman.
I'm afraid of dogs.
I'm Tom's cousin.
This engine works well.
It is absolutely impossible.
Is it hot?
She is in need of help.
Tom was my first boyfriend.
"You're really tall, aren't you?"
"Which do you like better, sushi or tempura?"
I'm eating out this evening.
Tom is by no means unintelligent. He is just lazy.
Have you ever been to Canada?
He fell in love with her at first sight.
We'll go when the rain stops.
I can't walk any farther.
I think that it's unlikely I'll be able to pass my driving test.
We have to start at once.
I'll be staying here for another three days.
Tom spoke French.
It was very difficult.
"If you hurry, there's a chance you can catch the bus."
I got off the train.
I caught a glimpse of him from the bus.
You may give this ticket to whoever wants it.
"In spring, the days get longer."
He's good at fund raising.
I'm happy to see you again.
Would you have asked me this question if I had been a man?
Are you going to stay in bed all day?
I'll reconsider the matter.
I have no time to engage in gossip.
His failure was due to his idleness.
The server was down.
How's your new job?
I love the blueberry tarts.
My uncle lived a happy life.
He was listening to music in his room.
My parents gave me a house when we got married.
He is a good man at heart.
Do you have a complaint to make?
I'll be in touch.
"To drive a car, you need a license."
I'm not as stubborn as Tom.
"As is often the case with teenagers, she's conceited."
He wants to sell his old car to a man in Kobe.
He answered all the questions in ten minutes.
Let's take a taxi.
Are you walking home?
"Fill out this form, please."
All of my grandparents are still living.
I didn't know Tom could speak French.
There are many wild animals around here.
We seldom get snow here.
Is it true that you wanted to live in Boston?
Does anybody in your family smoke?
"If you want this pen, I will lend it to you."
Can I speak with you a moment?
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
"Could you tell me the way to the station, please?"
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
She must have been very young when she wrote this poem.
I think I see something.
I couldn't find a parking space.
What a beautiful garden!
I agree with Tom.
I'd like this jacket.
I want to know more about your school life.
We are staying at our uncle's.
"Tom is very forgetful, isn't he?"
What are you doing now?
Do you like robots?
Did you study by yourself?
They concluded that he was lying.
I was at a loss for an answer.
Please answer the phone.
I think that my German is really bad.
Come as soon as you can.
It seems that the computer was infected by a virus.
"In two days, I'll turn 13."
She doesn't know what she really wants.
Tom knows a lot of people.
This should relieve the pain.
"You could be right, I suppose."
I always have room for dessert.
Are you a creature of habit?
I can't believe anyone anymore.
Your mom seems nice.
That is just typical of him.
Do I have to go right now?
Tom walked away and soon disappeared into the fog.
My eyes are very sensitive to light.
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
There is little chance of his winning.
I can't help you because I am busy.
I am often mistaken for my brother.
I'd like to visit London.
A lot of soldiers died here.
I might be able to help you.
Are your parents going to be home tonight?
The rumor may be true.
Today I want to eat something light.
There is no hurry.
It really depends on when.
"If I'd known you were sick, I could've visited you in the hospital."
She drives an imported car.
Do you take plastic?
Tom loved watching sports.
Tom is on a trip.
Tom kissed Mary on the lips.
What's so fun about taking pictures of trains?
My wish has finally come true.
The young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen.
Whose notebook is that?
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
The speaker hinted at corruption in the political world.
I didn't expect Tom to be at the meeting.
Are there any bears around here?
Thank you for your help.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
What you do is more important than what you say.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
Put your mask on.
I forgot my pencil case at home.
We love picnics.
"I told him, once for all, that I would not marry him."
"I'm sorry, but people I don't know can't come in."
Do you find me pretty?
Tom is hard to handle.
Tell me where the meeting will be held.
"If it were not for the snow, we could climb the mountain."
We will have to consider each application on a case-by-case basis.
This bike belongs to my younger brother.
Please hold on.
What did you do then?
This is something I didn't expect to hear.
He is as good as any player on our team.
Don't leave town.
He died three years ago.
I showed him into the room.
It's really stinky.
I never thought I'd want to buy an iPad.
What's your favorite thing about the Christmas season?
I'll go ask Tom.
I ordered new furniture.
She's curious to find out who sent the flowers.
Let's get together again tomorrow evening.
It took Tom fifteen minutes of googling before he found what he was looking for.
Tom knew Mary was busy.
He's really a good guy.
A group of young men were fighting.
I didn't know that Tom smoked.
"I thought so, too."
She recognized him immediately.
I don't like grapefruit.
A good biography is interesting and instructive.
Dreams sometimes come true.
He took out a book about the history of coins.
The cup broke.
I count on your help.
It never occurred to me that he might be an escaped prisoner.
Where is the restaurant?
I could not sleep because of the noise.
Playing the guitar is fun.
"If possible, I'd like to see him."
We went back to camp before dark.
The door was locked and we couldn't get in.
Tom kept me waiting for an hour.
I have a feeling that something dreadful is going to happen.
Be a good girl and eat your vegetables.
When will it begin?
Everyone loves him.
He couldn't stand being away from his girlfriend.
Come quickly!
Eggs go bad quickly in the summer.
My house isn't near the station.
The traveler stopped to ask me the way.
I'm used to eating alone.
You run.
A few students were left behind.
"Hi, my name's Tom. What's yours?"
We have time to spare.
Who wrote this poem?
Was Tom the one who taught you how to ski?
It's still being tested.
My watch keeps very good time.
He is seriously ill and unlikely to recover.
"Our teacher is really stubborn, isn't she?"
She asked us to dinner.
"Even though the accident was six months ago, my neck still hurts."
The TV doesn't work.
I've got a cold.
They are in the kitchen.
The ground was completely covered with snow.
Who taught you how to skate?
Tom is a very introverted kid.
All four of the boys didn't have alibis.
She is mad at you.
Father translated the French document into Japanese.
"Nothing could be done, except wait."
She looks prettier in her red dress.
Are you here to help us?
She was born in the 1950s.
I took care of it myself.
Actions speak louder than words.
My computer won't start up anymore.
I wish I was dead.
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Those are really big apples.
The dog hid under the bed whenever lightning flashed.
Her son is sure to succeed.
The rumor turned out to be false.
I feel happiest when I am in school.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Please fasten your seat belts and prepare for departure.
We've arrived.
That's what I expected it to be like.
It was time for a change.
Seventy or eighty years is the normal span of a man's life.
Even I was defeated.
It is estimated that there are over half a million words in English.
"In Thailand, people use coconuts for food, drink and toys."
He is on the radio.
Tom is in high spirits today.
She translated it word for word.
Keep the change!
I am short of money.
I will stay here till three o'clock.
Tom never wanted to get a divorce.
"One of the children is studying, but the others are playing."
It's hard to understand his ideas.
I'd like to be alone now.
He's studying history at college.
When did you begin learning French?
I compared my car with his.
The black one is mine.
The church is in the middle of the village.
The city was put in a difficult financial situation.
How many eggs could you get yesterday?
How did you get into my room?
"I had stage fright at first, but I got over it quickly."
It's been a long time since I had such a pleasant surprise.
He is either in London or in Paris.
She would often come late for school.
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
"Mother, having thought about it carefully, I don't feel I should marry him."
She got in the taxi.
We have no chance against those top players.
She always works hard.
I'm not a kid.
It may not be a dream.
I do not know this lady.
Could you help me wash the dishes?
"Tom isn't mad at us, is he?"
He is not as old as he seems.
His name has slipped my mind.
Exercise is the best way to get rid of stress.
The house by the lake is mine.
It is time to shut the gate.
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
We're less than halfway to the top of the mountain. Are you already tired?
I don't like lying.
A golf ball hit Tom.
He will be here in half an hour.
He felt himself being lifted up.
There's something in my eye.
Is there any more beer?
I thought that you were a nurse.
"Some believe in God, but others do not."
Take as many cookies as you want.
"When you finish reading this letter, burn it."
My father does not eat much fruit.
He was delighted to see you.
Let's get going.
I like that singer a lot.
I am a stranger here.
"Tom speaks beautiful French, without any accent."
I want to stay a few days.
We hired a company to get rid of the insects under our house.
She continued writing in her diary until she died.
Come over here.
My ears are ringing.
"What languages do you speak, Tom?"
"Open the window, will you?"
Is this made out of wood or metal?
Do you really have to go?
Take good care of yourself.
Hi. How are you?
Go and sit by your father.
Don't waste your time.
I've been trying to quit smoking.
When does the exam start?
This summer resort is no longer as popular as it used to be.
My brother is two years older than I am.
"If it's a good day tomorrow, let's go to the river to swim."
This feels soft and smooth.
His application went through.
She asked him not to leave her alone.
My father runs a restaurant.
I'm not tired at all.
"She has a boyfriend she's been going out with since high school, but she feels their relationship has stagnated, so she's become dissatisfied."
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
My grandfather on my mother's side passed away ten years ago.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
I am not in the least afraid of dogs.
I moved to the neighborhood about two years ago.
He has plenty of money in the bank.
Tom hated his French teacher.
My mother is making my father a cake.
Where have you been?
We hired Tom yesterday.
She went with him.
The dentist told me he has to pull out three of my teeth.
Tom is disappointed.
It's a big world.
"I took my temperature, but it was normal."
It'll take me a long time to finish reading that book.
He doesn't watch television at all.
I saw Tom and Mary waving their hands.
She likes him.
I didn't hear you.
I will telephone you later on.
Tom says he needs to ask Mary where she put his camera.
The lights went out just now.
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
This novel isn't as good as his last one.
Please come in and make yourself at home.
She is his real mother.
Tom came on Monday and went back home the following day.
Does anyone have an iPhone charger?
Who's your favorite left-handed baseball player?
It's been a long week.
Turn to me for help if you are in difficulty.
I pointed at him.
Help Tom and me.
My mother is easily moved to tears.
Life is too short to worry about things like that.
He has the ability to do the job.
Everyone speaks highly of him.
"When the battle ended, not a Texan was left alive."
This is the reason that she succeeded as a pop singer.
Tom killed himself.
Tom hasn't met Mary even once.
When is checkout time?
The old woman climbed the stairs with difficulty.
Is the post office still closed?
Mary was able to swim across the river.
They are longing for city life.
I'll see you next week.
Tom cooks.
I'd like to send this postcard to Japan.
Tom is waiting for Mary in the lobby.
Tom opened the safe and took out his passport.
Was Tom the one who did this?
Are you good at playing tennis?
Can she endure a long trip?
"You like English, don't you?"
Tom forgot to remove the price tag.
I kissed Tom.
"Westerners, in general, prefer to avoid such topics unless the other person brings them up."
Are these your things?
Mathematics is difficult for me.
Remove your shirt and lie down.
Tom intends to live in Boston for more than a year.
Tom tried to teach Mary how to do that.
Tom never talks about his kids.
Please come.
My neighbor always mows his lawn on Sunday mornings.
I can't take this anymore.
There are exceptions to every rule.
Why did Tom accuse you?
The Industrial Revolution took place first in England.
My only worry is that I have no worries.
My friend sent me a letter asking how I was.
"Christmas is soon, isn't it?"
You have a beautiful smile.
I love Australia.
He made it clear who had said such a thing.
Can I bring Tom?
My mother is still working in the kitchen.
Is Tom still with Mary?
Eating too much may lead to sickness.
Many young people are out of work in that country.
I like you a whole lot.
May I trouble you to pass me the pepper?
She met him only recently.
I haven't heard from him for a long time.
The waiting room was so noisy that I couldn't hear my name called.
I will show you around the city.
Tom went to the post office to mail a letter.
You shouldn't make any noise when you eat soup.
I told Tom he should study harder.
Tom explained the rules to me.
"As far as I know, Tom doesn't have a girlfriend."
Is there any butter in the refrigerator?
Please tell Tom that Mary called.
Tom crashed his car the same day he bought it.
Tom left here about thirty minutes ago.
They are talking over a cup of coffee in the cafeteria.
Where was the knife found?
He stole money from me.
I kept on singing.
Everybody's still awake.
This is delicious.
Have you finished your preparations for the trip?
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
"By the way, do you play the violin?"
Keep going.
Tom loved Mary a lot.
Tom spent a sleepless night thinking of Mary.
We're banking on you to provide all the money we need.
Let's not talk about Tom.
It's a small room.
I got to the station this morning.
"We get tired of beautiful women in three days, but in three days, we get used to ugly women."
Cucumbers are related to watermelons.
I'm supposed to eat with Tom this evening.
Bring along your friend.
He lost his eyesight in the accident.
The baby was sound asleep in her mother's arms.
Hey you! Please wait.
Would you like to come to my party?
She almost drowned.
What are you all talking about?
Are you sure it was a ghost?
She must have finished the work yesterday.
Her red dress made her stand out.
The wall has a large hole in it.
I put on my trousers.
The concert was a success.
Let me do this.
Tom blushed.
May I go out for a short walk?
Are you sure you don't want anything?
She is aggressive.
She is fond of cake.
This song reminds me of my childhood.
"Well, let's get going!"
She promised not to go out alone.
Are you crazy?
I've already sent an email to the support department.
We are in favor of your plan.
I don't think he is fit for the job.
I have a reservation for two nights.
Tell Tom that I'm going with Mary.
Tom and his friends use the school printer every month to print the student bulletin.
I have to go now.
You can always contact me.
I'd rather die than surrender.
You are early.
I don't have any cash on me.
How much is this tie?
What's the meaning of this phrase?
The motive for the murder isn't yet known.
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
She sings out of tune.
Tom bought a lottery ticket.
The price of everything increased.
I read the whole book in one evening.
He has a lot more money than I have.
Hay is for horses.
Tom got out of the jeep.
His proposals were adopted at the meeting.
"If we place an order for more than 20 units, would you reduce the price?"
"Which are you better at, boogie-boarding or surfing?"
"Once upon a time, there lived a stingy old man in the village."
Is there something that you want to tell me?
Is it a crime to encourage someone to commit suicide?
What's your major?
Are there any exceptions?
I get hives when I eat eggs.
There's a page missing.
That will put you in danger.
Are you planning to help Tom?
Do you think that I look like Tom?
He has a good head on his shoulders.
"When I woke up, it was snowing."
He often swears when he is angry.
I had my eyes checked.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
I hear music.
Tom doesn't know how to tie his shoelaces.
Her hair fell over her shoulder.
I'm glad the thief was caught.
I was having lunch.
Bananas are yellow.
Thanks for helping me.
She's absent because she's sick.
I am disgusted with you.
Tom doesn't know about Mary's death yet.
Did he tell you the truth?
Careful preparations ensure success.
I have some chores to do.
Tom will be thrilled.
I am thinking of going abroad.
Don't forget to bring a pen.
I did not want to attract attention.
I envy Tom.
She implied that she would like to come with us.
Tom didn't seem to be interested.
The English language is undoubtedly the easiest and at the same time the most efficient means of international communication.
I had a hard time trying to talk him out of taking the trip.
I won't cry.
"There was a sign saying, ""Keep off the grass."""
The light turned red.
Is it OK if I go out with Tom?
She set the world record for the high jump.
You'd better consult your doctor.
He sells fruit.
"Sorry, I'm late."
This is the house where my father was born and brought up.
"This is too easy, I guess."
Soldiers are used to danger.
She is going to be six next year.
Tom is probably angry.
I've decided to major in French in college.
I hope that she'll get well soon.
Go and wake Mary up.
A little bit of luck sometimes leads to an unexpected success.
She choked him.
Why is Tom here and not Mary?
Tom was a real hero.
The top of Mt. Fuji was covered with snow.
I'm going to go tomorrow no matter what.
I fractured my arm.
He can't walk any more.
Tom quit smoking.
I thought you had to get up by 7:30.
"Tom did it, didn't he?"
The first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.
He turned traitor.
I want to take a rest.
I have a mind to buy a new car.
I couldn't sleep well because it was noisy outside.
It's impossible.
Some have come to meet their friends and others to see theirs off.
Can you tell me exactly what you want to do?
I drank coffee.
How are you doing?
She is always cheerful.
I have two cats.
You shouldn't speak ill of others.
She's neither rich nor famous.
I remember that place.
I wonder why she is so worried.
No one noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
I saw a woman who I thought was Mary's mother.
He's an important person in the FBI.
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston.
I'd like to talk to you before I leave.
We'd love to work with you.
I'll have to think about it.
Tom took a selfie with his smartphone.
We need to leave at once.
Don't work too hard.
Is that why you were late?
He is afraid of death.
"Frankly speaking, it was difficult for me to make out what he was saying."
Please let me know.
There is nothing to do but apologize.
She can jump high.
It's too late now.
Tom still writes to me sometimes.
I acted as interpreter at the meeting.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
What makes you think so?
It is a four-hour drive from New York to Boston.
I hugged her tightly.
Nothing's as important as peace.
Tom was dying.
Are you still nervous?
Don't lie to Tom and me.
She helped the old man across the street.
We helped him financially.
Are you famous?
She spoke to me with a smile.
"What about me do you like? ""Everything."""
It is said that he knows the secret.
"Please speak loudly, so I can hear you."
The doctor advised him to cut down on drinking.
He sent me a birthday card.
I am engaged in AIDS research.
I heard the news on the radio.
People believe what they see.
What is the matter with you?
"My wife is a scientist, too."
I usually walk to school.
Turn on the radio.
"Well, I'm afraid I must be leaving. I had a nice time."
It isn't hard to do.
What do you call this bird in English?
The old man sat in the chair with his eyes closed.
This one is prettier.
Will you please help me?
Where did you see the woman?
I have a few minutes to spare.
Tell me again where you live.
Make your bed.
Tom and Mary spoke on the phone.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like your idea."
Pray for me.
May I see your passport?
He is absorbed in reading detective novels.
I won't be coerced.
"I lost the door key, so I can't enter the house."
It's your turn to answer the question.
What's the difference?
I don't love her.
"I'm going on a date with my boyfriend today, so I've been in a very good mood since this morning."
He was admitted to that school without taking the exam.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
That's a relief.
I can't stand it.
I have to talk to Tom right now.
I'll be home after football practice.
I ache all over.
I have a lot of work to do.
They have solved the problem once and for all.
Who stole the apple?
May I take pictures here?
I am very tired from the hard work.
He rarely gets angry.
Please forgive me.
"It's likely to get cold tonight, so you may need an extra blanket."
Let's play a game of baseball.
It's my job to help people like you.
My little brother can read English.
"Shall I heat this up? ""No thank you, it's fine."""
You are very kind to show me the way.
It is surprising that he should not know this.
Read the meter.
She's not a regular employee of this company.
We really don't have time.
Everyone was wearing a mask.
You always try to get what you want.
I cover twenty miles a day.
I don't like spinach.
What's the cause?
You can use my car.
Would you like to come?
Is Tom in pain?
Mind your manners.
Tom has never met me before.
I'd like to become a better person.
Tom noticed.
I go to school by bus.
"Tom isn't angry with me, is he?"
I like snow a lot.
Is there a dress code?
Is it OK if I stay home tomorrow?
I hope you will call again.
"Which is more important, me or your job?"
The typhoon struck the Kanto district.
Come on.
Tom is always daydreaming.
I bought her a new car.
He ate a box of chocolates.
I'm not pressed for money.
"Thirty dollars is a lot for that small room, he thought."
You can tell Tom what you want.
His car is two years old.
The nonviolent actions of Martin Luther King inspired many people.
The climate of Kochi is warmer than that of Kyoto.
Call a doctor immediately.
Your camera may be stolen if you leave it there.
A doctor told me that eating eggs was bad for me.
Are you sure you're ready?
Why don't you buy a new car?
How would you like your steak done?
"As far as I know, he has never come on time."
What's that building?
I'm a doctor.
Tom is in a very good mood.
I didn't see the sign.
What's the purpose of your visit?
Tom lives with his uncle in Boston.
She boiled the eggs.
I've been trying to cheer Tom up.
Were both Tom and Mary in class today?
I must send for the doctor.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
I didn't realize that you were feeling so bad.
He has been sick for a week.
The lady's funeral was held at the local church.
Let's go!
I'm not going if Tom is.
He always keeps his room as neat as a pin.
Do you believe that God exists?
The children are sleeping. Please don't be so noisy.
When did you take the exam?
When will your new novel be published?
Find out where Tom is.
"When he returned, he brought a baseball cap and gave it as a present to his friend."
Is that a new shirt?
I like you very much.
"Mary looks like her mother, but her personality is different."
You should conform to the rules.
How do I get reimbursed?
Tom said he was hungry.
I'm left-handed.
There is little hope of success.
I was about to go to bed when he called me up.
Can you distinguish silver from tin?
I want to cook for you.
We're learning French.
Your speech was appropriate for the occasion.
Tom is probably the only one around here who can speak French.
He is always punctual.
Did you enjoy your holiday?
"Nobody likes him, because he is always blowing his own horn."
Tom came about 2:30.
That wasn't difficult.
He is afraid of making mistakes.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
He chose to live in Tokyo instead of Osaka.
No one knew that.
Don't leave things half done.
Tom doesn't like sports.
Is there anything you want to buy?
Tom bought the cheapest thing in the store.
I made an appointment to see the doctor at four o'clock.
"Shall I close the window? ""Yes, please."""
She often calls him names.
He's busy with his homework now.
This CD belongs to my son.
I don't like the way he speaks to me.
Would you mind my using this dictionary?
This isn't my first time to drive a sports car.
Tom admitted his mistake.
I know a good French teacher.
I don't know what to say.
We can see more and more swallows.
Please speak louder so everybody can hear you.
Tom was sitting on a bench eating something that looked like an apple.
Are there a lot of tall buildings in Boston?
I had a strange dream last night.
He was all wrong.
Let's leave early.
Tom appeared from out of nowhere.
Please phone him.
My big brother finished his homework very quickly.
It isn't clear which of them wanted that.
I can recommend this restaurant.
"Frankly speaking, I hate him."
These girls are more charming than the ones I met yesterday.
I'll take care of the bill.
Tom had no way of knowing that this would happen.
My dog follows me whenever I leave the room.
Don't worry about it!
She came to Tokyo when she was eighteen years old.
He shouted at the top of his voice.
Why do you need that?
How many CDs do you have?
The cat was sick last week.
I know it myself.
Don't forget to pick me up tomorrow morning.
My father made me a nice lunch.
We provided food and clothes for them.
He died an unnatural death.
They can speak Spanish.
Please come back at once.
Just stay at home.
I explained the procedure to him.
When are they going to put the book on the market?
We need to talk about this.
Please wait until the end of this month.
I don't know anything about him at all.
Cockroaches are insects.
I'd like to open an account.
"Beef, please."
I didn't care.
I don't want anything to drink.
Tom can already do that.
Do they speak French in Canada?
He never drinks alcohol.
Do you have cough drops?
I always eat out.
She's stubborn.
Speak up!
Tom maxed out his credit card.
Have you ever heard of Nessie?
The large audience clapped at the end of the song.
I don't want to buy that bag.
The storm has gradually abated.
"It doesn't matter who says that, it's not true."
He is a man of action.
She is fond of animals.
She pointed her finger at him accusingly.
Grab Tom.
What does this pen cost?
Don't go near the water until you learn how to swim.
May I call you tomorrow?
Cheer up.
I wanted to play tag.
We could read.
I can't agree with you.
Can you tell wolves from dogs?
He carries a bag on his back.
Please give me some kind of medicine to curb the pain.
We must sit down.
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
Please wait a minute.
I feel very cold.
"After walking for an hour, we stopped to take a rest."
Tom studied French for many years.
You can sleep late tomorrow morning.
She isn't at home now.
Are you sure that's what you want?
The boy lost his way in the forest.
I want some ice cream.
I've had it with Tom.
Does your stomach hurt?
"If you are going to have a party, please count me in."
Tom is a friend of mine.
This dam supplies us with water and electricity.
I'm not so sure Tom is right.
I'd like you to translate this book into English.
The way you talk is going to get you in trouble someday.
Do you know when they will arrive?
She was ashamed of her children's behavior.
Give me a shot.
That was less interesting than I thought it would be.
He hopes to go abroad.
Money is everything.
There is a toy shop in the neighborhood.
The sun is setting below the horizon.
Tom always wears blue shirts.
I wanted to help you.
"Oh, sorry, I didn't know it was against the rules."
Tom is a good friend of mine.
The refrigerator door was open.
Tom began to sweat like a pig.
Everyone would like to believe that dreams can come true.
I never want to see that guy again.
"Obviously, someone is lying."
She suggested to me that I call off the meeting.
Tom will not let Mary go.
We must study English.
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
See you at 2:30.
Can you tell right from wrong?
Tom inherited all of his father's property.
She rode a camel.
He made her a bookshelf.
I'm used to living alone.
"With a little more patience, you would've succeeded."
I'm sure that she has arrived at the village by now.
Tom won't listen.
He's staying at a hotel.
May I ask you a question?
She played a part in the women's lib movement.
Don't flatter yourself.
What are you two doing?
Never tell a lie.
What happened?
Why can't you come?
Have you completed your preparations for tomorrow?
Arabic is read from right to left.
Is it still raining?
"Some people think that it is difficult for a native speaker of English to learn Chinese, but I disagree."
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
Tom was my boyfriend.
They demanded the king be put to death at once.
I came into a huge fortune.
I bought a scarf for my grandfather on my father's side for his 88th birthday.
She doesn't have any enemies.
She was on the verge of killing herself.
How long did it take you to get to Boston by plane?
I'm dying of thirst.
"If you want to lose weight, you should cut down on between-meal snacks."
She kept on talking.
How long did Tom work here?
You're wearing your shirt inside out.
He is a cheerful young man.
I felt refreshed after a swim in the pool.
I want to catch the six o'clock train to New York.
"In a word, life is short."
That's a good idea!
Have you ever read Gulliver's Travels?
You should take care of yourself.
He overheard the conversation by accident.
My attitude towards him changed.
Let's rest here.
I try to be positive all the time.
"As the train went by, Tom caught a glimpse of the driver."
You left the refrigerator open.
Why did Tom kill himself?
Tom and I go to the same high school.
Remove your hat.
Let's meet at the station at eight tomorrow morning.
The climate of Canada is cooler than that of Japan.
Are both of you ready to go?
You'd better call a lawyer.
Tom can't tie his own shoes.
"When his dog died, he cried his heart out."
Make yourselves comfortable.
I wish I were a prince.
She closed her ears to what he was saying.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
What are you talking about?
Don't ask me to choose between you and my job.
Breathe normally.
Please raise your hand before you speak.
Tom is heavy.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
You're lying.
Don't play catch in the room.
I am four months pregnant.
I must go home.
What's your blood type?
The board of directors is going to discuss the proposal next Tuesday.
She has finally reached the Arctic.
A good many people were there.
I prefer poetry to novels.
He advanced me a week's wages.
My father has been dead for three years.
I apologize for yesterday.
I don't like you.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
Go to sleep.
I want to buy a book to read on the plane.
The king abused his power.
How many kinds of cheese do you use on your pizzas?
How long is this?
I got up while it was still dark.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom tells you.
I lost my camera.
Step back.
I don't like studying.
What language is spoken in America?
Charge this to my company.
We were nearly frozen to death.
I was made to wait for a long time.
I would love to see it.
How much does this watch cost?
"At last, we got to the lake."
Are you wearing a wire?
I love you more than anything.
The only one who didn't do that was Tom.
What do you do for a living?
"As the train came to a halt, all of the passengers wondered what was happening."
This is the house where I was born.
Christmas is around the corner.
I don't know where to go.
There is no place like home.
Our car was fast and soon got ahead of the other cars.
Hold the ball in both hands.
He is a genius.
Don't shut your eyes.
No way!
I don't like iced coffee.
My father is getting bald.
You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
Matters are becoming worse.
He is able to swim very fast.
He is something of a stamp collector.
Someone is obviously telling a lie.
He can read English easily.
Neither Tom nor Mary know how to speak French.
He was never to see his parents again.
You wouldn't go to the dentist when you were a boy.
Don't you think this computer game may be a little too difficult for Tom?
This material stretches easily.
This video is boring.
Close the refrigerator.
Did you turn the light off in the living room?
Did the girls finish eating?
Who's that gentleman?
Please drop in when you happen to be in the neighborhood.
Can you give me a little bit more time?
I would rather starve than steal.
The boy was silent.
Do you have a five-pound note?
Tom doesn't listen to anybody.
It's extremely cold today.
I need sleep.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
Look after Tom.
Is Tom married?
"Go and get a chair from the next room, please."
It wasn't my mistake.
They are typical young people.
I like dogs.
He is used to traveling.
It seems like summer is finally here.
Tom slowly sat up.
I suggest that the meeting be postponed.
Tom appeared on television last night.
Excuse my clumsiness.
He walked slowly so the child could follow.
Is Tom your friend?
The game was not exciting at all.
I couldn't see any stars in the sky.
Let's decide together where to go first.
"You're going to do that today, aren't you?"
Tom and Mary don't have much time to talk together. Their children are always demanding their attention.
I kept singing.
I think that we'd better leave early.
It went just as we expected.
"To tell the truth, I don't really care."
Nobody can get along with such a person.
We have exams right after summer vacation.
You're lying.
This book has many beautiful pictures.
I'll take three of each kind.
We couldn't go out because of the heavy rain.
All are present.
How long have they been playing tennis?
Let's do that at Tom's house.
Why did Tom need a hammer?
"I think Tom is from Australia, but I'm not sure."
I haven't finished breakfast yet.
A good coach is like a parent to the players.
I love you more than anything in the world.
Is there a movie theater near here?
He seems to be honest.
She's had a hard life.
I've decided to go to Boston instead of Chicago.
He is as brave a man as ever lived.
"Since I haven't received an answer, I was wondering if maybe my mail never got delivered to you."
This is the doghouse that I made myself.
I love this chair.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
Tom offered Mary a chair.
You lied to Tom.
Few people noticed her absence from the party.
Do you have some kind of hobby?
I like this striped shirt.
A bear can climb a tree.
"They sell apples, oranges, eggs, and so on."
It isn't my fault.
He looks down on women.
"How was the test? ""It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be."""
What sort of a person is Tom?
Turn right at the second corner.
Is that rule applicable to us foreigners?
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
Where is the ticket office?
He almost never went there.
I've been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
Do you have a fever?
Where's your grandmother?
Let's find a solution that's acceptable to everyone.
Tom's mother died in 2013.
I don't like him.
Tom lowered his voice and told Mary that he loved her.
I've seen it.
This is the key I've been looking for.
Let me drive your new Toyota.
It was really interesting.
Let's meet on Sunday.
I am considering how to settle the matter.
I'm thirteen years old.
Tom opened the window to let in some fresh air.
Is your mother at home?
The baby has been crying for a long time.
Tom is in London on business now.
I was leaving home when Tom telephoned me.
Correct me if I am wrong.
The police informed us of the accident.
Are you sure this is Tom's suitcase?
It's broken.
We need a new babysitter.
She happily granted my request.
How much time will that take?
I could have helped you with your work.
Is it too far to walk?
Stop staring at me like that.
"I haven't been feeling too good lately. ""You had better go to a doctor."""
Do you still love me?
There is no connection between them.
I have hiccups.
My parents have just arrived at the station.
They went to the mosque to pray.
Have you met any of Tom's friends?
I want to go to another country.
He cut down a tree in the garden.
She stayed there for a moment.
This wine is cheap.
He glanced at her.
May fifth is Children's Day.
Did you phone him?
Come a bit closer.
We walked along the river.
"If I have time, I'll do it."
Tom took the wrong train.
They are about the same age.
"Will you pass me the sugar? ""Here you are."""
I have a credit card.
I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.
"She is rich, certainly, but I don't think she's very smart."
She hardly ate anything.
The results for the English exam this time were very good.
Nobody would listen to me.
What do you think I should do?
It is difficult to relate to someone who has different values from you.
Mt. Fuji is very beautiful.
I am afraid of dogs.
She lived in Hiroshima until she was ten.
I'll be at home the next time she comes.
He will visit his uncle.

I was caught in a shower and was drenched to the skin.
I'm satisfied.
I'm not a very good dancer.
Tom picked up a coin.
I expect her to pass the examination easily.
I will go on foot.
Social customs vary from country to country.
I came to apologize for what happened yesterday.
The game has been postponed indefinitely.
This is how the accident happened.
Let's meet at 6:30.
My wife is obsessed with cleaning.
I have to go now.
"If I were to go abroad, I would go to France."
Three students made short speeches and introduced themselves and their countries.
She cried.
She's completely crazy about him.
Tom can't figure out how to get the box open.
I guess you're right.
I have to cover his loss.
I think that it's unlikely that I'll be able to pass my driving test.
I want to speak to Tom.
Women usually live 10 years longer than men do.
What do you think of it?
"The rain hasn't stopped yet, has it?"
I disagree.
I know Tom is a university professor.
She is kind.
He is not in.
Please give me a cup of coffee.
I've only just come back.
Give me a break.
Our train stopped suddenly.
It's quite clear to me that that is the truth.
That's a good idea.
I think Tom is obstinate.
Tom stole a police car.
I was aware of being watched.
I think we'd better leave early.
"You're really good at French, aren't you?"
I thought it went well.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
He set fire to the school building.
Did I hurt his feelings?
Call me if you need assistance.
His pride won't allow him to ask questions.
The corridor was so crowded that we couldn't walk.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
Tom can't speak French.
Can I borrow your pen?
Tom had a weird dream last night.
It's so cute.
I wanted a jacket.

I checked my briefcase and umbrella in the cloakroom.
Surfing is a lot of fun.
The temperature has suddenly dropped.
You will soon accustom yourself to the new life.
I can't decide where to eat lunch.
What time is it now?
Tom switched on the TV.
"Excuse me, would you show me how to use the washing machine?"
Tom and Mary are both studying French.
I'm going home now.
I admire people who express their opinions frankly.
It rained for a week.
Don't ever touch my things again.
"If I were you, I would follow his advice."
I'm really lonely.
It looks like there's an elevator over there.
She got married at the age of 25.
The child was hiding behind a big tree.
They laugh at him behind his back.
I must open the window.
I intend to study abroad next year.
"After dinner, I did my homework."
Tom needs a haircut.
I will be back by nine.
"After hearing the sad news, she broke down in tears."
Tom isn't sleeping.
He is certain to come.
I have a lot of work to do.
Is there someone here who speaks English?
He couldn't get the job.
Many people die in traffic accidents.
It's so easy.
You'd best follow the doctor's advice.
Did he propose to you?
Are you still on the team?
Tomorrow's my birthday.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
Tom doesn't seem to be as passionate about that as Mary seems to be.
She felt like taking a walk.
"Fortunately, no passengers were injured."
What do you call this animal in French?
I prefer soccer to baseball.
We live near the large library.
"In spite of the fact that he's 38, he's still dependent on his parents."
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I'm a little busy.
It began to rain heavily more than three hours ago.
It's improved.
What does he intend to do?
Don't be mad.
I was almost hit by a car.
Do you have anything hot to drink?
What time will Tom arrive in Boston?
Warn Tom.
Perry finally sailed into Tokyo Bay in 1853.
Is Tom really going to eat that?
Let's just listen.
My father is busy now.
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
I would like to have something to munch on with my beer.
I wonder whether Tom has seen this movie.
It's great to see you got home safely. How was Australia?
Tom caught more fish than I did.
Is it already open?
She was looking forward to seeing him again.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.
I want to go abroad.
Could you hang up the laundry?
I had my photograph taken.
I have a sore throat from a cold.
That was the first time that a man walked on the moon.

It's no use telling me anything.
The teacher caught the student sleeping in class.
This is a car imported from Germany.
Please turn off the lights.
My body aches all over.
I don't worry so much about my resume.
Are you in pain?
"He tried it again, only to fail."
When was the last time you got your hair cut?
She wanted to go out anyway.
The reason for my silence is there was nothing special to write about.
Let's start the party.
Tom lives in a larger apartment than mine.
Did you use to live here?
Tom still lives at home.
You guys are idiots.
I told Tom I would do my best.
I hurried to the station only to find that the train had already left.
Did Tom seem busy?
Tom talks about Mary almost all the time.
I was just thinking of a new job.
Is the movie theater near the station?
Tom will help you if you ask him to.
Oh my gosh! You're the last person I expected to meet in a situation like this.
I've already done everything you've asked me to do.
"As far as I know, he's guilty."
I was criticized for doing that.
Read between the lines.
I don't want to go shopping by myself.
I would never have guessed that.
Is this really real?
He is very busy now.
Are you going to see Tom tomorrow?
The news filled her with sorrow.
Are you good at math?
This university was founded in 1843.
I don't like any of them.
I don't think many people can say they're satisfied with their salary.
A good idea came to mind.
Today is a holiday.
Please remember to mail this letter.
Listen to this!
Traveling abroad is very interesting.
How old are your children?

Clean up the room.
Did you forget your money?
"You guys haven't eaten yet, have you?"
Do you think I should throw this away?
"That knife wasn't sharp and I couldn't cut the meat with it, so I resorted to using my pocket knife."

I ate a lot.
Just look in the mirror.
He climbed Mt. Fuji.

I arrived safe and sound this morning.
This hat cost ten dollars.
She was almost hit by a car.
He is full of ambition.
I think it's unlikely that any store would sell this model for that price.

I really like that dress.
I made a mistake.
Is this a picture that you drew by yourself?
Can I buy only the lenses?
