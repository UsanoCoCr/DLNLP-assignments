Is he sleeping?
I couldn't understand him at first.
She is a fox.
"Generally speaking, boys can run faster than girls."
Thanks for everything.
What was his reaction to this news?
I hope you have sweet dreams.
You should've called.
Get out of the kitchen.
Tom wanted to buy a new smartphone.
He's not the kind of person who always criticizes others.
I guess I'll be living with you a year from now.
"I used to eat pizza, but now I don't."
Tom had a heart tattooed on his arm.
He is young at heart.
She struggled to get up.
"When writing a sentence, generally you start with a capital letter and finish with a period (.), an exclamation mark (!), or a question mark (?)."
You're just guessing.
My mother teaches flower arranging.
It frosted last night.
You are very beautiful.
Haven't you eaten lunch?
Tom and I went to the same high school. He was two years above me.
Tom doesn't know where Mary lives.
A trickle of blood ran down his neck.
Why should I apologize to you?
Were there any stars in the sky?
He is not as tall as his father.
The castle is now in ruins.
Bees make honey.
You're a kind man.
I hate when this happens.
It's just what I wanted.
This hat is too small for me.
He looks well.
Is Tom complaining?
He quit smoking cold turkey.
I am through with my work.
"Are you all right, Tom?"
The storm prevented me from leaving.
She had no sooner read his letter than she tore it up.
She listened to music for hours.
The new station building is under construction and will be completed soon.
"Tom sprang out of bed, threw on some clothes, ate breakfast and was out of the door within ten minutes."
This'll do.
Tennis began in France in the thirteenth century.
What do you do in your free time?
That newspaper has a large circulation.
Do I have to take this medicine?
How did your weekend go?
I got him to repair my car.
I'm sorry for calling so late.
Tom is almost never late.
What did you have for breakfast?
He is good at mathematics.
It's cheaper to order things by the dozen.
I don't have any money and I don't have any friends either.
I really love her younger sister a lot.
I keep a journal.
When you start looking like your passport photo you should go on vacation.
No one knows what's going to happen.
Is he breathing?
He always treats me like a child.
Taiwanese food is milder than Indian food.
I'll think about it.
Have you ever been to the Tokyo Dome?
How much is the handling charge?
Tom said that he'd never ever do that.
You must come every six months for a check-up.
This room is for rent.
Who do you live with?
Tom is busy making breakfast for the family.
She arranged the flowers beautifully.
I'm glad that Tom is safe now.
There's almost no water in the bucket.
It is sunny today.
Please find some hotel where the rates are moderate.
He dreaded having to spend Christmas in the hospital.
Keep in touch with me.
Over 100 people were present at the party.
Have you seen my new car?
"Will you help me with my English homework? ""Certainly."""
Our prospects for victory are excellent at the moment.
He called me up from Tokyo.
"Tom was supposed to come with us, but he didn't show up."
What is your name?
"Pass me the butter, please."
Are you full?
Turn down the TV.
What Tom said really hurt me.
I met her in the winter several years ago.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
Prices are stable these days.
I'm too excited to eat anything.
I had my wallet stolen while I was asleep.
Please limit your presentation to 30 minutes.
The accident caused a traffic jam.
I don't have time to read.
I'll help Tom.
Why are you looking so sad?
She was the first girl I'd ever kissed.
Today's paper reports that the premier has given up the idea of visiting America.
It seems that Tom is lying.
My uncle was involved in the traffic accident.
I don't like living in the country.
Is Tom still working here?
Tom is joking.
Have you ever tried skydiving?
Come back.
It's to your advantage to learn everything you can.
You should leave here at once.
I won't see him anymore.
Is this too big?
I like love stories.
"In addition to being a good teacher, she was a great scholar."
He will soon return home.
My mother cut the cake.
He's a late bloomer.
Am I clear?
Are you ready for dinner?
Please pull over.
He is likely to be late again.
She got up at seven in the morning.
Do you like bowling?
Do you know who made it?
I think that Tom was hungry.
"She can speak French, and is even better at English."
This bus can hold fifty people.
There is a little time before the train departs.
We must think over the issues carefully.
Would you like to wait?
Give me a ring if you find out anything.
Tom and I want to study French.
There are only three girls in the class.
She succeeded in getting him to tell the truth.
A stranger living nearby is better than a relative living far away.
That's great!
Illness prevented him from attending the meeting.
"The bus now arriving is going to Domestic Terminal 1. Passengers for the International Terminal, please wait. The shuttle bus to the International Terminal also leaves from this stop."
Are you going to work until 10:00?
Please turn in the report by the end of the month.
You can have it for nothing.
Do you see anything?
"I'd like an aisle seat, please."
I didn't think that you were going to have the chance to meet Tom.
The child cried herself to sleep.
I have a migraine.
I have an idea.
What do you do for fun?
What's wrong with running around your house naked?
Fill in the blanks.
"This computer is powerful, efficient, and easy to use."
Are there any bananas?
What can I do for you?
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired.
I bought them each a present.
I went to the hospital to see my uncle.
It was such a shock.
I want something cold to drink.
This animal is very clever.
Do you have any objections?
Give me a hug.
It isn't going to happen.
Tom is rather optimistic.
The old man lived there by himself.
He deals in hardware.
"Although he is rich, he is not happy."
What would you like to do tomorrow?
"They're both Canadians, aren't they?"
Bring me some water.
Tom suddenly realized he wasn't alone.
Don't worry about it!
Tom and his wife live separately.
Did you feed the dog this morning?
I think that Tom was in Boston.
I hope that she'll get well soon.
What does Tom consider to be the most important point?
I don't understand it at all.
You are to obey your parents.
One drop of this poison is enough to kill 160 people.
Tom would like to live in this country.
He's a liar.
"I'm sorry, I meant no offence."
I am the tallest in our class.
He lives just around the corner.
I need to find a better job on the double to pay my bills.
Are all of you guys homeless?
Tom isn't a good boy.
That doesn't sound too hard.
I've never said such a stupid thing.
Didn't I lend you some books? I'm sure I did.
Where can I leave my bicycle?
She looked lonely.
Have you stopped loving me?
Tom has red hair and freckles.
We've won!
Come and see me whenever you want to.
"Huh, where did Tom go?"
I asked her to send us the book.
I've caught a cold and my head hurts.
He was drafted into the army.
Do you know how to tap dance?
I'll give you five minutes.
He came home dead tired.
Tom slapped Mary.
How much did that beer cost?
Tom wrote down his phone number.
Can you help me?
He looked up at the sky.
She crossed the street.
I returned home from Boston yesterday.
How was your summer?
It's here.
Tom is wearing a surgical mask.
"Because the entrance was locked, we couldn't enter the house."
Is it true that you've never played poker before?
I'd be happy if you'd help me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I no longer want to hurt anyone.
Tom retired when he was 65.
Perhaps we'll see each other again tonight.
Does it taste okay?
What're you doing here?
We felt relieved when we saw a light in the distance.
I'm not going to leave until I find out what happened.
You can borrow three books at a time.
Tell me Tom's email address.
That disease is incurable.
The concert was a success.
"Line up by height, please."
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday.
Which one do you think she chose?
Tom translated the article into French.
"The moment they saw me, they waved."
I think either one is fine.
I'll call you up this evening.
Is the watch on the table?
That old man is a fussy eater.
You don't need to go.
"Excuse me, what time is it?"
I drank the coffee.
How do you like your new job?
No one believes that he is innocent.
She advised him not to use too much sugar.
He has stopped smoking.
Tom never loses his temper.
The patient's condition changes every day.
He gets his hair cut once a month.
Tom probably doesn't like you.
Christmas Day is December 25th.
Whose book is this?
Tom kicked Mary in the stomach.
We read the letter again and again.
The workers came to ask about their pay raises.
We were unsure what kind of person Tom would be and whether he would like living in the same house as us.
Let's eat lunch outside.
My father-in-law is a lawyer.
It's obvious that you told a lie.
I cook on Mondays.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
Lock the door!
It used to be taboo for women to smoke.
Let's grab something to eat.
Please excuse my being late.
I've got no friends.
Few men have direct access to the president.
I got up about five.
The moon has come out.
This is probably a real diamond.
How's that business going?
The girl singing over there is my sister.
I pretended to be listening.
Give me a little time to think it over.
How can Tom be so stupid?
The eager spectators crowded into the stadium.
Tom is in the attic.
"If there's a problem, please let me know."
"The words are on the tip of my tongue, but I don't quite know how to say what I want to say."
Rome is an old city.
Tom doesn't understand what Mary is trying to say.
We crossed the river by boat.
Tom is our oldest son.
How is Tom doing?
I spent twelve hours on the train.
Get a move on!
Why are you speaking French to Tom?
Did you listen to the broadcast of the National Diet's debate?
Will you show me your photo album?
Tom never asked why.
He found that all his efforts amounted to nothing.
This book is smaller.
Send me there.
I think that she will come.
I can't wait for summer vacation to start.
I love to read books.
I had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert.
You're going too far.
You should concentrate on one thing and learn to do it well.
He likes green the best.
Tom was too angry to speak.
I study French for three hours every day.
It's ironic.
Tom is making dinner.
Do what you want to do.
She cannot have done such a thing.
That's why I was absent from school yesterday.
Her silence surprised me.
Speak clearly.
There was blood all over the floor.
I need coffee.
Get out your notebooks.
This smells great! What are you cooking?
Who wrote this poem?
Can you see the difference?
I didn't remember his name until afterward.
We've had all kinds of weather over the past few days.
Am I your girlfriend?
Tom loves cats.
But I don't want to.
Give me a glass of water.
I can't afford a new car.
I'll pay for it.
Christmas is only two weeks off.
Let's arrange the details later.
"As a boy, I used to go fishing."
I've nothing to give.
The Prime Minister will hold a press conference tomorrow.
The cookies are in the jar.
Nothing is so appealing as the innocent face of a sleeping baby.
What does that word mean?
He's not a liar.
She is trying to lose weight.
It's been a long week.
Close your mouth.
It's now or never.
Are your parents at home?
Were you able to help Tom?
"You've already decided not to go, haven't you?"
It is about time you went to school.
You can visit me tomorrow.
Tom looked nothing like his profile picture.
The pain you go through because of love is by far sweeter than any other pleasure.
There isn't any milk left.
I don't remember where I met Tom the first time.
The plants must've died because no one watered them.
What time is dinner served?
I'm very glad I wasn't there.
She goes to the hospital once a week.
He is able to play the guitar.
I want Mary.
What's the average height of the players?
I rarely walk to work.
Everybody wants to sit beside her.
Is Tom really asleep?
Tom wanted to run for class president.
Is there another word for synonym?
I seem to have lost my purse.
It's so sweet.
I fell down the stairs.
Please call me at my hotel later.
There's nothing to be done about it.
Don't you want to know why I didn't do that?
I trust Tom completely.
A true gentleman would not betray his friends.
She is playing with her friends.
"You can drive a car, can't you?"
America is a country of immigrants.
He says that he has to go to Vienna the day after tomorrow.
What do you have to add to 17 to get 60?
What does it mean?
I politely turned down his offer and hung up.
I saw a house with a red roof.
There is a pond in the middle of the park.
He was unable to completely give up on his hopes of marrying her.
He got all he wanted.
"Speak more slowly, please."
I don't want to become a doctor.
I think Tom is going to faint.
Turn in your homework.
Tom doesn't need glasses anymore.
He often falls in love.
How did you get into my room?
Tom is a pushover.
"Because of the dense fog, nothing could be seen."
This house isn't very large.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
Tom is an illegal immigrant.
Hang on!
I don't see much of him.
I found the box empty.
I'm afraid I have a touch of a cold.
Could you do me a favor?
See the example given above.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
Tom is seldom late.
May I have your room number?
It is going to snow.
Take off your mask.
"May I use your pencil? ""Sure go ahead."""
How do you eat this?
How should I eat this?
There is no feeling in my toes at all.
Have you eaten dinner?
We don't have sugar.
I didn't quite make out what he said.
Do you know how long they have been married?
I'm looking forward to receiving letters from you.
"You're both Canadians, aren't you?"
What're you doing?
Is Tom a student here?
This book is really old.
I've just arrived at the station.
Buy some milk on your way home.
I have to be absent from school for the moment.
He got home at six.
"Give me something to write with. ""Will this do?"" ""Yes, it will do."""
He hit me on the head.
I found the test difficult.
Do you really think Tom's wounds are self-inflicted?
I had a dream about you last night.
Tom stopped.
Knock it off.
Welcome.
Wait a while.
Please keep in touch.
You aren't supposed to smoke in here.
Her birthday party will be tomorrow evening.
Are you saying you don't want to go to Tom's party?
I'll admit I'm wrong.
The flowers wilted.
I saw him enter the room.
Are the elevators working?
This can is empty.
I don't have a choice.
This kind of cat doesn't have a tail.
"It will cost around 10,000 yen."
She left the hospital an hour ago.
I can't believe it!
Do you think that you can come?
Tom has no children.
"If you hadn't had my advice, you would have failed."
How did the accident happen?
What are they doing here?
I got this book from him.
They formed themselves into a circle.
See you tomorrow at school.
She started dancing when she was eight.
Wait a bit longer.
There is an urgent need for social change.
Tom is sitting alone in the waiting room.
My mother made some new clothes.
I was allowed to take a week off.
I've just gotten home and had dinner.
Do you have a pain reliever?
Tom is depressed because his girlfriend left him.
"That's not fair, is it?"
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
Love is like the measles; we all have to go through it.
Today is a very hot day.
I'm fairly sure I'm right about this.
Go and see for yourself what has happened.
"You're not a mechanic, are you?"
She was late because of the heavy traffic.
The prices of vegetables are down.
I'm afraid the rumor is true.
She looked out of the window.
There's an orange on the table.
I got to Australia three days before Tom did.
"It's important, so I'll do it."
"This looks longer than that, but it is an optical illusion."
It's really dangerous.
He is a fast speaker.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
Where in Austria did you grow up?
I thought you were my friend.
Help me.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
It's not worth reading any further.
I built this doghouse by myself.
He isn't an American.
The football game is now being broadcast.
She is cooking for him.
Where do I get on the number 7 bus?
I love that commercial.
I thought that was the case.
We are acquainted with his family.
Who is that old woman?
Do you know what's happening?
What are you drinking?
His argument was far from rational.
"Suddenly, it started to rain very hard."
That was the last time I saw Tom.
He earns more money than he can spend.
"I was the last one to start in the race, but I soon caught up with the others."
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
He drank three bottles of beer.
The train was hurrying west.
Tom dyed his hair brown.
I'm going to spend the New Year's holiday this year relaxing at home.
He's a slacker.
It is already eleven.
Do you know your blood type?
You're absolutely right.
She did not say anything.
Some believe in UFOs and others do not.
He wiped his hands on a handkerchief.
Switzerland is a neutral country.
Tom was arrested for speeding.
Do you really mean it?
She is friendly to everybody.
Tom is really depressed.
I never actually saw Tom and John fighting.
Why did you decide to buy this house?
Italy isn't Greece.
Do you have a reservation?
You can have it for nothing.
Fulfill your duty.
Are Tom and Mary really dating?
Tom giggled again.
How much rent do you pay for the apartment?
The instant I saw him I knew he was angry.
"Tom did it, didn't he?"
Tom is quite optimistic.
I hate waiting.
I write in my diary every day.
I must get going.
Doing that was stupid.
Chew your food well so it can be digested properly.
I miss you.
Smoking isn't permitted on the train.
Is there anywhere I can go to find a flea market?
Our dog was nearly run over by a car.
Wait right there.
"Where are your books? ""They are on the desk."""
I thought you guys were planning on coming to my party.
Don't use this hammer.
Tom can't tie his shoes by himself.
He has a perfect swing.
She knows everything about cooking.
Can I borrow a pen?
I addressed the envelope containing the invitation.
I am not the least bit worried.
Tom is always eavesdropping.
Those shoes go well with this white skirt.
Tom sent Mary many letters.
"I learned that woman I thought was a nurse is, in fact, a doctor."
Tom can't dress himself and he can't feed himself.
I like playing chess.
They kept it to themselves that the king was dead.
I've lost faith in that doctor.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand English well."
Your phone's ringing.
Please wait five minutes.
I'm a twin.
Tom swims very fast.
She wept bitterly.
He's a big liar.
Could I have a cup of coffee?
I don't want to go alone.
She has two cats. One is white and the other one is black.
"Despite his riches, he's not contented."
A wise man would not say such a thing.
This egg is fresh.
She stayed up late to finish sewing your dress.
May I kiss you?
They were made of rough brown leather.
I always have trouble pronouncing that word.
I want to be a nurse.
She went on speaking.
Is that what you mean?
Everybody knows that he likes her and vice versa.
He seldom goes to church.
"No matter how hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can."
Give me a little more water.
The snow prevented the airplane from taking off.
"If I were Tom, I would've punched Mary in the face."
This water isn't drinkable.
Use your head.
Tom was tired and in a bad mood.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
Everybody likes polite people.
It's about time to start.
Christianity and Islam are two different religions.
Pneumonia causes difficulty in breathing.
Learning languages is interesting.
I don't like men like him.
I was injured while I was skiing.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji twice.
Many economists are ignorant of that fact.
It's really cold today.
He's very interested in Japanese.
Tom put the ring on Mary's finger.
Your brother is very angry.
I met him the day before yesterday.
Are you cold?
An antique pot was dug out.
There were three hundred cardboard boxes filled with old clothes ready to be sent to the disaster area.
The attempt ended in failure.
Are you sleepy?
The price of gasoline is so high that we cannot buy a big car.
"On February 14th, Americans celebrate Valentine's Day."
This is just water.
I met an old man near the station.
I'm fortunate compared to him.
We took a mud bath.
What are you thinking of?
My grandmother lives in the country.
Is it true Tom doesn't know any French?
My grandfather is still active at eighty.
Never in my life have I heard such a thing.
He's probably sleeping.
It is hard for me to put my thoughts into words.
This is surprising.
We've been waiting for hours for you to show up.
Their losses reached one million yen.
It isn't complicated.
She is a noted singer.
"I'm sorry, but I didn't understand what you said in English."
Am I handsome or not?
I don't think this is funny.
Fifty years ago anyone could have bought the land.
What're you reading?
Tom showed Mary his stamp collection.
The country's economy is about to collapse.
I'm working from home today.
Do you plan to work until 10:00?
He doesn't tell lies.
I want you out of here.
Why don't you pull over and take a rest for a while?
I like chocolate.
I think he will be glad to see you.
Theory and practice do not necessarily go together.
You should have been more careful in money matters.
The outraged employee resigned at once.
Tom is out.
This house isn't new.
Originally they were farmers.
The police arrested the suspect.
Tom is at home now.
I'll have exams right after the summer holidays.
Have a seat.
Australia is rich in natural resources.
Tom went to Boston once.
How many wars are going on at this time?
He escaped from prison.
Europe is now reported to be entirely free of new cases of this disease.
Their modest income doesn't allow for many luxuries.
Can you call me a taxi?
We had a lovely meal.
He caught a boy stealing his watch.
We really thank you for your patronage.
Don't ever do that kind of thing again.
Tom is a hunk.
Doctors did everything they could to cure him.
My father is very strict with me.
The hounds are in pursuit of the fox.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
That play was popular.
This building is very large.
Tom needed some food.
What have you been doing?
I'm good at mathematics.
Do you still love your wife?
I know I'm in trouble now.
Is it clear?
I can't speak French as well as Tom can.
She keeps complaining that she has no time.
"I thought I would be nervous, but I was cool as a cucumber."
It's almost time to go to bed.
She finally managed to get a hold of her old friend.
I concentrated my attention on the lecture.
"Although the arguments were rational, he was not convinced."
I hate to eat alone.
I have a lot of homework to do today.
We thoroughly enjoyed the delicious meal.
Are you already drunk?
He committed five murders.
We talked until two.
Don't take it out on me.
Tom's my friend.
You've helped me a lot.
These are as good as those.
It was you that suggested seeing that movie.
I'm younger than he is.
Do you know if he's coming to the party?
Why does Tom need my help?
The children are riding their bikes.
That's a good buy.
Why is it you're always late?
My daughter lost almost all the coins she had collected.
He was educated by her grandfather.
Do you have anything for a headache?
My English teacher has advised me to read these books.
"The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic."
"His name, I believe, was Tom."
You look so pale.
Next year my birthday will fall on a Sunday.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Is Tom still working?
Do you have Stevie Wonder's new album?
"Now that my brother is a university student, he has to do a lot of reading."
She married him.
Leave it to me.
Can you please open the window?
I have been to the station to see my friend off.
Maybe Tom likes someone else.
I'm going to take a nap.
Do you have children?
They're a couple.
I was too tired to walk any more.
The moon is coming up over the mountains.
Tom followed the bus on his bicycle.
The two houses stand alongside of each other.
She got off at the next station.
Don't you know I'm going out with Tom?
I think it'll snow tomorrow.
It's not mine.
It's your turn to drive.
Tom looked at the price tag once again.
He's agreed to do the job.
I don't think that this is interesting.
Tom switched the TV on.
We thought it wise not to continue our trip.
He took the job reluctantly.
She said that it might be true.
Who was this poem written by?
Try it out.
She pressured him to quit his job.
Tom buttered a slice of bread.
I recognized him at once.
Tom yawned.
What's going on here?
Are you going someplace?
What's the next stop?
Twenty teams entered the tournament.
I resent their rude attitude.
"We'll also have to create a separate smoking section, won't we?"
Tom saved a seat for me.
"Drunk in moderation, alcohol is not harmful."
She lives in a large house.
Tom has never been sick.
What are you up to today?
I hear that you are having an unusually cold winter.
Ignorance is bliss.
He died at the age of 70.
"She was born in 1946, on August 19, in California."
It's bad luck to say that.
I did not understand him at all.
"Generally speaking, Americans like coffee."
"If he had been there, I could have given him your message."
The accident took place near that intersection.
Can't you talk to Tom for me?
I am accountable to him for the loss.
I like him.
It is nice to see you again.
I'm going to be late for work.
Tom made his choice.
Don't worry. We're doing just fine.
Tom is a true friend.
"No matter where I go, I get lost."
I wonder whether or not Tom has seen this movie.
Tom often doesn't keep his promises.
What seats do you want?
We play volleyball every Monday.
This is not very stylish.
Tom is learning English.
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I'm a doctor.
We heard the church bells.
We met him on the way there.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
Tom spends a lot of time helping Mary do her homework.
I have a feeling that she will come today.
I think I have a cavity.
Is that my coffee?
"He got up quickly, splashed cold water on his face, brushed his teeth, and shaved."
Please see that the birds in the cage get water and food every day.
Is this the first time you've eaten Japanese food?
I threw away my shoes.
"Can I come tomorrow, too?"
He is prone to getting excited.
I have no one to turn to for advice.
Tom bought a camera for Mary.
War isn't good.
I can't remember doing that.
He left after he had lunch.
"No matter what I do, she says I can do better."
He is one of my neighbors.
