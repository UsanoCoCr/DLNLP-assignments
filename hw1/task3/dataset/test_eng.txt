Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
They abandoned the plan.
This book is full of dirty jokes.

Coffee keeps me awake.
I have to get some sleep.
They have been on good terms with their neighbours.
It's as cold as ice.
Let's get it over with.
Rise and shine.
The speaker requested that the audience remain silent.
You'll miss the train.
They mistook him for his brother.
"I won't quit, no matter what you say."
"What day is it? ""It's Wednesday."""
Tom is always cheerful.
They failed the exam.
Ask her if she'll sew up the hole in your jeans.
The train was held up for two hours on account of the snowstorm.
We deliberated whether we should cancel the reservation.
This book is heavy.
He is not what he used to be.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
He was unable to move.
There is much more water in this lake now than in the past.
A cold bath refreshed him.
We want to learn some Spanish songs.
This garden is open to the public and it's free.
I don't have a car.
The noise set the dog barking.
I wonder if he'll come tonight.
What a blessing it is that they did not come.
What did you have to eat?
Any student can answer that question.
I left home early because I didn't want to miss the train.
Is he busy?
She was carrying a basket full of flowers.
Tears fell from her eyes.
Things didn't work out between Tom and Mary.
Do you like apples?
Does your stomach hurt?
I'm sorry that we're so late.
She met him only recently.
"If you're sleepy, you should sleep."
The ship sank with all her crew on board.
Good job!
I think that it's true.
There's no place like home.
Do you regret marrying me?
Smoking is prohibited.
Do you want to play tag?
Is everybody ready?
I quit smoking.
When was the last time you saw your boyfriend?
The damage from the flood was negligible.
I fell off the ladder.
I'm not quite sure if we can meet your requirements.
He quit.
Follow your dreams.
I haven't yet finished breakfast.
Please let me off here.
He likes tigers.
He used to love her.
Let's get together again next year.
I am not accustomed to making speeches in public.
I can't look at Tom.
Do you really think that Tom is from Australia?
Do you love my brother more than me?
We have to finish everything before Monday morning.
They invited me to the party.
There's a storm coming.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
"In front of the water fountain, there was a young woman accompanying herself on a guitar."
Can you find out if Tom speaks French?
"Were I you, I would not do such a rude thing."
"I said, ""Could you please turn your television down?"""
Please write with a ballpoint pen.
Tom said he wanted to study French.
It may snow in the afternoon.
I have a lot to do today.
Can you give me a ride to the station?
Just go home.
Who broke the vase?
I had doubts.
I didn't know what to say to him.
Can you call a taxi for me?
Has the movie started yet?
How about taking a rest?
She didn't like living in the city.
"I should've kept my mouth shut, right?"
He's a fast walker.
He admitted he had taken bribes.
She's intent on going to New York to study fashion.
This glass contains water.
Is Mary wearing eye shadow?
Why didn't you come to yesterday's party?
"At that time, Tom wasn't very happy."
How can I get in touch with you?
I can not afford to keep a car.
The baby was splashing in the bathtub.
Same-sex marriage is legal here.
I can't wait for summer vacation to start.
What's wrong with being naked?
What are you insinuating?
I'm the tallest in our class.
What is the tallest mountain in Europe?
This has nothing to do with you.
I am poor at tennis.
Tom turned on the heater.
I was very surprised at the news.
This chair is really comfortable to sit on.
This afternoon the weather is going to get worse.
Where can I try this on?
Have a nice time.
Tom walked over to the desk.
These eggs are fresh.
The earthquake was the biggest one that we had ever experienced.
I'm not a bit tired.
Tom was tall and handsome.
Is she so stupid that she believes such a thing?
"I think Tom, without question, is going to win."
Your garden needs some attention.
Don't you have anything smaller than this?
I have caught a cold.
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
The heavy rain prevented us from going fishing.
The situation is extremely critical.
I wasn't aware that you were feeling that bad.
May I kiss you?
The reporters continued to ask questions.
I knew why Tom did that.
I'm anxious to know the results of the blood test.
I've always wanted to go to Australia with my family.
What did you buy?
"Besides being a doctor, he was a very famous novelist."
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom would be interested in buying your old MP3 player.
She wanted him to say that he loved her.
I'm looking for a simpler solution.
I'm bored to death.
He started to sing.
I can speak English.
That naughty child needs a good beating.
She successfully got him to tell the truth.
I read The Great Gatsby when I was in high school.
The television is broken.
I'm going to pick Tom up.
The one who drew this picture was Tom.
Tom looks really guilty.
You should go to the police and check it out yourself.
I don't care.
Is that what you really want to do?
Do you know whether she can speak English?
He never opens his mouth without complaining about something.
"Hey, what's going on?"
"He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't."
Do you see anything else?
No one spoke.
She fainted when she saw blood.
The shop is open from Monday to Saturday.
"It took more than a month to get over my cold, but I'm OK now."
He went out the window.
It's about the size of an egg.
I play tennis every Monday.
I know it was serious.
He can mask his feeling if the occasion calls for it.
Tom didn't know their names.
She did not turn up.
She managed to keep up appearances.
We want a new carpet.
"If we'd been on that plane, we'd be dead now."
He comes here twice a week.
I should have followed Tom's advice.
He had a hasty breakfast.
I don't think her story is true.
The house was very badly built.
I had my suitcase carried to my room.
Old people are inclined to look back on the past.
Tom is still angry.
How many kilograms did Tom lose last summer?
The picture brought back a lot of memories.
Let me know if you are in need of anything.
We cannot put up with their rudeness any longer.
The plane flew over Mt. Fuji.
I turned on the lights.
I had a phone call from him.
I'm sorry I have troubled you so much.
He stood up and took a deep breath.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
You're right.
I wouldn't regret this later.
What is this animal called in Japanese?
"I'm home, Tom."

Does anyone in your office speak French?
I worked hard all day long yesterday.
How long will you stay here?
I'm seeing you in a new light.
Have you ever gone skiing with Tom?
Our baby cannot talk yet.
Fasten your seat belt.
Tom is going to do something about it.
I'll give you just one more chance.
Do you like swimming?
Tom made me hurry.
You're really cute.
Who left the window open?
I hope it's better tomorrow.
I turned to him for advice.
"Weather permitting, let's go on a picnic."
Was the door open?
Is his father a doctor?
The Hikari runs at a speed of 200 kilometres an hour.
She's busy.
Please take off your hat.
Please refrain from smoking here.
What a genius he is!
Who's the man playing the piano?
Tom lacks confidence in himself.
"It's cold, so I want to eat something hot."
She thinks about him when she's feeling lonely.
He will accept any money he can get.
Please reply as soon as you get this email.
Tom suddenly started to cry.
I hope that he will succeed.
I agree with your opinion about taxes.
Tom isn't watching TV now.
I'm anxious whether I'll do well at this new job.

He gets a haircut once a month.
This dictionary isn't useful at all.
You have to apologize at once when you have done wrong.
I need to understand the meaning of this sentence.
We're a married couple.
Tom bought Mary some chocolates.
Sales have dropped off at every big department store.

Whose shoes are those?
There is no other choice.

I agree with his opinion.
What's that noise?
Get me up at eight.
Don't write in library books.
Is that all?
I have a good sense of smell.
Please relax.
You'd better not swim if you've just eaten.
It doesn't sound too bad to me.
I watched TV this morning.
I come from Australia.
The door opened.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom?
Get out.
He hurried to the house only to be disappointed to find that it was empty.
"Will you study after dinner? ""Yes, I will."""
I meant what I said before.
That's his house.
I'm going to buy myself a motorcycle.
"Although Tom is sick, he plans to get his homework done on time."

When does it begin?
Turn right at the next intersection.
Do you drink?

She gained weight.
I caught sight of her in the crowd.
This book has many pictures.
Do you have an airplane ticket back home?

I'm glad I was there.
This history book is written for high school students.
How can I get to the station?
I'm glad to hear that.

Have both of you already eaten?
His business in New York was a great success.
The president is out now.
What should I call you?

Have you ever been to Boston?
Would you like anything else?

I know how old you are.
Nobody likes being laughed at.
It's not easy to believe.

I went on reading.
She is not a good person.
"At last, they were reconciled."
Can you wait a little while?
I heard a pistol shot.
Let's speak French.

Don't underestimate my power.
She opened the door.

The dawn is breaking.
He threw the ball.
"Helen Keller was blind, deaf and mute."
